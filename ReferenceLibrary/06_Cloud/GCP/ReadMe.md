## üè¢ Reference Architectures

### Web Applications
- Scalable Web Applications on GCP
- Serverless Architectures with Cloud Run
- Microservices with GKE

### Data Solutions
- Data Analytics with BigQuery
- Real-time Data Processing with Dataflow

## üìù Best Practices

### Security
- Implement least privilege with IAM roles
- Use VPC Service Controls for network isolation
- Enable Cloud Audit Logs for compliance
- Implement security perimeters with VPC

### Scalability
- Design for horizontal scaling with managed instance groups
- Implement global load balancing with Cloud Load Balancing
- Use Cloud CDN for content delivery
- Apply autoscaling for compute resources

### Cost Optimization
- Use resource labels for cost allocation
- Implement scheduled shutdown for non-production resources
- Choose the right machine types
- Consider committed use discounts

### Resilience
- Design for regional and zonal failures
- Implement exponential backoff for API calls
- Use Cloud Monitoring for observability
- Apply global load balancing for multi-region applications
