## 🛠️ **Practical Projects for Week 1**

### **Mini-Project: Vehicle Management System**

Implement the same system in all three languages:

```
Vehicle (base class)
├── Car
├── Motorcycle
└── Truck

Features to implement:
- Properties: make, model, year, engine
- Methods: start(), stop(), getInfo()
- Inheritance: specialized methods for each vehicle type
- Polymorphism: array/list of vehicles calling same methods
```

### **Learning Checkpoints:**

**Daily Check-in Questions:**

- [ ] Can I explain this concept to someone else?
- [ ] Can I implement it without looking at examples?
- [ ] Do I understand WHY this design choice was made?
