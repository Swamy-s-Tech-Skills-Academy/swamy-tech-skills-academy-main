## Bag of Words

What it does:
Counts how many times each word appears in each sentence (or document). It builds a vocabulary of unique words and then makes a table of counts.

Why it’s useful:
Lets us compare sentences by the words they contain and how often. Helpful for search, clustering, or as input features for ML models.

Tiny example (3 sentences)
Sentences:

1) "This movie is awesome awesome"
2) "I do not say is good, but neither awesome"
3) "Awesome? Only a fool can say that"

Vocabulary (sorted): ["a", "awesome", "but", "can", "do", "fool", "good", "i", "is", "movie", "neither", "not", "only", "say", "that", "this"]

Counts matrix (rows = sentences, columns = vocabulary):

| sentence | a | awesome | but | can | do | fool | good | i | is | movie | neither | not | only | say | that | this |
|---------:|:-:|:------:|:---:|:---:|:--:|:----:|:----:|:-:|:--:|:-----:|:-------:|:---:|:----:|:---:|:----:|:----:|
| 1        | 0 |   2    |  0  |  0  | 0  |  0   |  0   | 0 |  1 |   1   |    0    |  0  |  0   |  0  |  0   |  1   |
| 2        | 0 |   1    |  1  |  0  | 1  |  0   |  1   | 1 |  1 |   0   |    1    |  1  |  0   |  1  |  0   |  0   |
| 3        | 1 |   1    |  0  |  1  | 0  |  1   |  0   | 0 |  0 |   0   |    0    |  0  |  1   |  1  |  1   |  0   |

How to read it

- Row 1 has "awesome" twice, and contains the words "is", "movie", and "this" once each.
- Row 2 includes many single‑occurrence words like "but", "do", "good", "i", "is", "neither", "not", "say", and one "awesome".
- Row 3 contains words like "a", "awesome", "can", "fool", "only", "say", "that" each once.

Notes

- Bag of Words ignores order: "movie awesome" equals "awesome movie".
- It captures counts, not meaning. Later, TF‑IDF and embeddings improve on this.

## Code just of reference

```python
def bag_of_words(sentences):
    """
    Creates a bag-of-words representation of a list of documents.
    """
    tokenized_sentences = [clean_tokenize(sentence) for sentence in sentences]
    flat_words = [word for sublist in tokenized_sentences for word in sublist]
    vocabulary = sorted(set(flat_words))
    word_to_index = {word: i for i, word in enumerate(vocabulary)}

    bow_matrix = np.zeros((len(sentences), len(vocabulary)), dtype=int)
    for i, sentence in enumerate(tokenized_sentences):
        for word in sentence:
            if word in word_to_index:
                bow_matrix[i, word_to_index[word]] += 1
    return vocabulary, bow_matrix


# Example of usage
corpus = [
    "This movie is awesome awesome",
    "I do not say is good, but neither awesome",
    "Awesome? Only a fool can say that"
]
vocabulary, bow_matrix = bag_of_words(corpus)
print("Vocabulary ({}):".format(len(vocabulary)), vocabulary[:20])
print("Bag of Words Matrix shape:", bow_matrix.shape)
print(bow_matrix)

# Optional: view Bag of Words as a labeled table
import pandas as pd
bow_df = pd.DataFrame(bow_matrix, columns=vocabulary)
bow_df
```
