# Learning Journey - Active Weekly Learning Plans

## Purpose

This folder contains active weekly learning plans that provide structured, day-by-day learning schedules for mastering programming concepts and skills.

## Current Focus

**Week 1 (July 15 - August 4, 2025)** - OOP Foundations (21 days, 1 hour daily)

## How to Use

1. **Follow Daily Schedule**: Each day has specific learning objectives and deliverables
2. **Track Progress**: Use checkboxes to mark completed deliverables
3. **Build Incrementally**: Each day builds on previous learning
4. **Practice Hands-On**: Heavy emphasis on coding practice and implementation

## Current Files

- `Notes/` - Daily capture-only notes (one file per day)
- Templates in `00_Templates/` for daily logs and weekly retro

## Learning Approach

- **Sustainable Pace**: 1 hour daily commitment
- **Multi-Language**: Build competency across Java, C#, Python
- **Practical Focus**: Real coding projects and implementations
- **Progressive Complexity**: From theory to advanced implementation
- **Cross-Language Comparison**: Understand differences and similarities

## Benefits of This Structure

- **Clear Daily Goals**: No ambiguity about what to learn each day
- **Manageable Time Commitment**: Only 1 hour daily
- **Practical Deliverables**: Real code and implementations
- **Language Competency**: Multi-language understanding for architecture decisions
- **Foundation Building**: Proper progression from basics to advanced concepts

## Next Steps

- Start Week 1 on July 14, 2025 using the planning section
- Update daily progress during the week
- Complete retrospective on July 18, 2025
- Use insights to create Week 2 file

## ⚡ Quick Start (lightweight, no heavy planning)

1. Open your backlog: `Backlog.md` and pick one 60-minute item
2. Create today’s log: copy `00_Templates/Daily-Learning-Log.md` into this week file
3. Capture evidence (code or notes) and check off one small deliverable
4. End of week: use `00_Templates/Weekly-Execution-Template.md` for a 15-min retro

Start here for capture-only: `Notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
