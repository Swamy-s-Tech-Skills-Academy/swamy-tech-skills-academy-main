# Learning Journey — Active Learning (Capture-only)

## Purpose

This folder is for capturing what you actually learn each day. No heavy planning—just daily notes and evidence.

## Current Focus

Current focus: Capture-only notes in `Notes/` (one file per day)

## How to Use

1. Create today’s note in `Notes/` (see `Notes/README.md`)
2. Capture a tiny deliverable (code or notes) and link evidence

## Current Files

- `Notes/` - Daily capture-only notes (one file per day)
- `00_Templates/` - Optional helpers (Daily log)

## Learning Approach

—
Lightweight guidelines:

- 1 hour daily is enough
- Prefer doing and capturing over planning
- Link to code or notes as evidence

## Benefits of This Structure

- **Clear Daily Goals**: No ambiguity about what to learn each day
- **Manageable Time Commitment**: Only 1 hour daily
- **Practical Deliverables**: Real code and implementations
- **Language Competency**: Multi-language understanding for architecture decisions
- **Foundation Building**: Proper progression from basics to advanced concepts

## ⚡ Quick Start

1. Open `Notes/README.md` and click “Today”
2. Capture what you did (bullets) and add evidence links
3. Optional: 15-min retro on Friday using `00_Templates/Weekly-Execution-Template.md`
