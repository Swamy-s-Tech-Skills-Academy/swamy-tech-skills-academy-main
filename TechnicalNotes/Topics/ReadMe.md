# Topics

This folder contains in-depth technical content organized by subject area rather than chronology.

## Purpose

- Provide comprehensive, consolidated information on specific technical topics
- Organize knowledge by subject for easy reference and discovery
- Reduce duplication by centralizing related content
- Offer a structured learning path for each technical domain

## Structure

- **Clean_Architecture/** - Clean architecture principles, CQRS, MediatR, domain-driven design
- **Cloud/** - Cloud technologies, services, and best practices (Azure, AWS, GCP)
- **DevOps/** - DevOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, containers
- **Patterns/** - Software design patterns, architectural patterns, and implementation examples

## Guidelines for Topic Content

1. **Organization:**
   - Each topic may include multiple related documents
   - Use clear, descriptive filenames
   - Consider using numbered prefixes for sequential content (e.g., `01_Introduction.md`, `02_Core_Concepts.md`)

2. **Content Format:**
   - Begin each document with a clear title and brief overview
   - Include a table of contents for longer documents
   - Use consistent heading levels (H1 for document title, H2 for major sections, etc.)
   - Include code examples, diagrams, and practical applications where possible

3. **Cross-Referencing:**
   - Link to related topics when relevant
   - Reference daily journal entries where the topic was explored
   - Cite external resources and references

4. **Maintenance:**
   - Update documents as understanding evolves
   - Archive older versions rather than overwriting them completely
   - Include "Last Updated" dates at the top of documents
