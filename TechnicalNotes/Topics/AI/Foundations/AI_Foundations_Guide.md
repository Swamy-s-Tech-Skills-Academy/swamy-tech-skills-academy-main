## Introduction to AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect.

### Key AI Concepts

- **Narrow AI (Weak AI)**: AI systems designed and trained for a specific task
- **General AI (Strong AI)**: AI systems with generalized human cognitive abilities
- **Machine Learning**: Systems that learn from data without explicit programming
- **Deep Learning**: A subset of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction with an environment and feedback
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Processing and understanding human language
- **Computer Vision**: Enabling machines to interpret and understand visual information

## Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**:
   - Training on labeled data where the desired output is known
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Applications: Spam detection, price prediction

2. **Unsupervised Learning**:
   - Learning from unlabeled data to find patterns or structure
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Applications: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection

3. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Learning through trial and error with rewards/penalties
   - Examples: Q-learning, Policy Gradient Methods
   - Applications: Game playing, robotics, recommendation systems

### Common ML Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**: Predicting continuous values
- **Logistic Regression**: Binary classification
- **Decision Trees**: Rule-based classification and regression
- **Random Forests**: Ensemble of decision trees
- **Support Vector Machines**: Finding optimal boundaries
- **K-Means Clustering**: Grouping similar data points
- **Principal Component Analysis**: Dimensionality reduction

## Neural Networks & Deep Learning

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the structure of the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

### Neural Network Basics

- **Neurons**: Computational units that take inputs, apply weights, and produce outputs
- **Activation Functions**: Functions that determine the output of a neuron (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)
- **Forward Propagation**: Process of computing outputs through the network
- **Backpropagation**: Algorithm for updating weights based on error gradients

### Deep Learning Architectures

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Specialized for visual data processing
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Process sequential data with memory
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: Advanced RNNs with better memory capabilities
- **Transformers**: Architecture based on self-attention mechanisms
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Generate new content through competing networks
- **Autoencoders**: Self-supervised learning for efficient data encoding

## Natural Language Processing

NLP enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in useful ways.

### Key NLP Concepts

- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into words, phrases, or characters
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Identifying grammatical parts of speech
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifying entities like people, places, organizations
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining emotional tone in text
- **Language Modeling**: Predicting the next word in a sequence
- **Machine Translation**: Converting text from one language to another

### Advanced NLP Techniques

## Embeddings & Vector Representations

Embeddings are dense vector representations of discrete objects (words, documents, images) that capture semantic relationships.

### Working with Embeddings

- **Word Embeddings**: Represent words as dense vectors
- **Document Embeddings**: Represent entire documents as vectors
- **Image Embeddings**: Represent images in vector space

## Semantic Search

Semantic search understands the searcher's intent and the contextual meaning of terms to improve search accuracy.

### Semantic Search Architecture

1. **Text Processing**:
   - Preprocessing and cleaning text
   - Tokenization and normalization

2. **Vector Embedding**:
   - Converting text to vector representations
   - Using models like BERT, USE, or custom embedding models

4. **Similarity Search**:
   - Finding nearest neighbors using cosine similarity or other distance metrics
   - Hybrid search combining lexical and semantic approaches

### Implementation Considerations

- **Model Selection**: Balance between accuracy and performance
- **Vector Dimensions**: Higher dimensions capture more information but require more resources
