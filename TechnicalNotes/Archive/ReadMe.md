# Archive

This folder contains older versions of technical content that has been superseded by newer versions but may still contain valuable information or context.

## Purpose

- Preserve the history of technical documentation and knowledge
- Maintain access to previous approaches and solutions that might be relevant in specific contexts
- Track the evolution of understanding on various technical topics

## Contents

The archive is organized by original source and date of archival. Each archived document includes a reference to its replacement or successor in the current knowledge base, if applicable.

## Guidelines for Archiving

1. **When to archive:**
   - When significant updates are made to existing documentation
   - When content becomes outdated but still has historical value
   - When duplicative content is consolidated

2. **How to archive:**
   - Prefix filenames with the archival date (YYYY-MM-DD_)
   - Add a note at the top of archived documents indicating:
     - When it was archived
     - Why it was archived
     - Where to find the newer/current version
   - Maintain the original content untouched after the archival note
