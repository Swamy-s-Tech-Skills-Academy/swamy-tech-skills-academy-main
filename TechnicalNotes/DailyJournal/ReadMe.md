## Journal Entry Guidelines

1. **Format:**
   - Use the date as the title (e.g., `# 2025-01-06 - Monday`)
   - Include subtitles for different topics covered
   - Use markdown formatting for readability

2. **Content:**
   - Brief summaries of what was learned
   - Key insights and takeaways
   - Questions for further exploration
   - Links to detailed notes in the Topics folder
   - Code snippets or commands used (if brief)

3. **Cross-Referencing:**
   - When a topic is covered in depth, create or update a document in the appropriate Topics folder
   - Include a link to the detailed topic document in the daily entry
   - Use relative links when possible (e.g., `[Clean Architecture Guide](../../Topics/Clean_Architecture/CQRS_Guide.md)`)

4. **Monthly Index:**
   - Each month should have an index file (index.md) listing all entries with brief descriptions
   - The index helps quickly locate content by scanning monthly summaries
