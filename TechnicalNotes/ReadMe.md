- **DailyJournal/** - Chronological record of daily technical learnings and notes
  - Organized by year and month
  - Contains links to detailed topic notes
- **Topics/** - Subject-focused collection of consolidated notes and references

  - **Cloud/** - Cloud-specific learnings (Azure, AWS, GCP)
  - **DevOps/** - DevOps practices, CI/CD, containers
  - **Patterns/** - Design and architectural patterns

## 🚀 Purpose

This folder consolidates technical content that was previously scattered across daily notes and backup folders, providing:

1. **Topic-Based Access**: Find information by subject rather than by date
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Consolidated guides instead of fragmented information
3. **Preserved Chronology**: Maintain a journal of daily learnings with links to detailed content
4. **Knowledge Evolution**: View how understanding of topics developed over time

## 🔄 How to Use

- **Looking for specific technical content?** → Navigate to the relevant topic folder
- **Want to see what was learned on a specific date?** → Check the DailyJournal
- **Need older versions or superseded content?** → Check the Archive folder

## 📝 Contribution Guidelines

When adding new content:

1. Place topic-specific content in the appropriate Topics subfolder
2. Update the daily journal with a brief note and link to the detailed content
3. Move older versions to Archive rather than deleting them
4. Maintain consistent formatting and structure
