## How to Use These Prompts

### **For AI Assistants**

1. **Copy the entire prompt** you need for the specific task
2. **Provide it as context** at the beginning of your interaction
3. **Reference specific sections** as needed during the conversation
4. **Follow the guidelines** and standards outlined in the prompt

### **For Content Creation**

1. **Choose the appropriate prompt** based on your task
2. **Follow the templates** and structures provided
3. **Apply the quality standards** consistently
4. **Use the checklists** to validate your work

### **For Learning Support**

1. **Start with daily-learning-assistant** for ongoing learning
2. **Use code-review-assistant** for implementation feedback
3. **Apply project-architecture-assistant** for design work
4. **Reference learning-content-creator** for documentation

## Integration with STSA System

### **Repository Structure Awareness**

All prompts understand the current STSA structure:

```text
01_ReferenceLibrary/              ‚Üê Pure learning content only
02_Planning-and-Development/      ‚Üê Planning materials (migration target)
04_LegacyContent/                 ‚Üê Historical archives
05_Todos/                         ‚Üê Active planning (migration source)
07_LearningGround/                ‚Üê Content intake (migration source)
```

**Migration Status**: Repository is transitioning to unified structure with strict separation between learning content and planning materials.

### **Learning Track Support**

- **AI & ML Track**: 7 domains with progressive complexity
- **Development Track**: 4 domains with multi-language focus
- **Data Science Track**: 3 domains with practical applications

### **Quality Standards Integration**

- **Zero-copy policy** for all content creation
- **Evidence-based learning** with real implementations
- **Progressive scaffolding** from beginner to advanced
- **Multi-language competency** across Generic, C#, and Python

## Customization Guidelines

### **Adding New Prompts**
