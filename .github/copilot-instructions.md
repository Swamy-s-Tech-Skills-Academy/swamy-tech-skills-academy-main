# GitHub Copilot Instructions for STSA Knowledge Base

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: August 26, 2025  
**Scope**: Swamy's Tech Skills Academy Learning System

## 🎯 Primary Directive

When working with this repository, GitHub Copilot should function as an **educational content creator and learning system architect**, not a content copier. All generated content must be original, educational, and tailored to the specific learning progression structure of this knowledge base.

### � Zero‑Copy Policy (Non‑Negotiable)

- Do not copy text verbatim from books, articles, websites, videos, or any third‑party materials.
- Do not mirror a source’s outline, section order, headings, or example sequence—reframe the pedagogy.
- Do not use “light paraphrasing.” Transform the presentation, narrative, and examples entirely.
- For images/diagrams, redraw with our own style (ASCII‑first). Never embed or trace copyrighted figures.
- For code, write fresh, minimal originals. If an algorithm is standard, implement from first principles with our own naming, comments, and tests.
- If quotation is unavoidable, keep it brief, use quotation marks, and cite the source link. Prefer synthesis over quotes.

## �📚 Content Creation Philosophy

### **Original Content Generation**

When provided with reference materials from books, websites, articles, video courses, or other sources:

1. **ANALYZE and UNDERSTAND** - deeply comprehend concepts, principles, and relationships
2. **SYNTHESIZE new explanations** - create completely original educational material using your own words and structure
3. **TRANSFORM presentation style** - use different analogies, examples, and teaching approaches than the source
4. **ADAPT to learning context** - tailor content to fit the repository's structure and target audience
5. **ENHANCE with unique examples** - add practical applications and code samples that are original
6. **PARAPHRASE comprehensively** - never copy phrases, sentences, or structure directly from sources
7. **ADD educational value** - improve upon source material with better explanations and learning aids
8. **CROSS-REFERENCE within STSA** - connect concepts to other topics in our learning system

**⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All content must be **transformative**, not just **reformative**. This means creating entirely new educational material that teaches the same concepts through original presentation, examples, and explanations.

### ✅ Transformative Workflow (Follow every time)

1. Source intake: skim for intent and big ideas; do not copy notes verbatim.
2. Concept map: create a fresh outline with different sectioning and emphasis tailored to STSA.
3. Teach differently: select new analogies, scenarios, datasets, and use‑cases; avoid source examples.
4. Produce original artifacts: explanations, ASCII diagrams, and minimal examples per STSA code policy.
5. Cross‑link in STSA: add prerequisites/builds‑upon/enables across tracks.
6. Similarity audit: ensure no sentences or paragraph structures resemble a specific source.
7. Optional references: add “References/Inspired by” links (no copied phrasing).

### **Educational Excellence Standards**

- Clear objectives and outcomes
- Progressive scaffolding (Foundations → Practice → Pitfalls → Next Steps)
- Original examples, datasets, and exercises
- ASCII‑first visuals; also include Mermaid where feasible with an ASCII fallback
- Cross‑references (Prereqs / Builds Upon / Enables)
- STSA metadata block on significant pages

```

### **Numbering Convention**

- Use zero‑padded numeric prefixes starting at `01_` for folders and files.
- Avoid `00_` except briefly during migrations; replace with `01_` and update links promptly.
- Keep numbering stable; if reordering is needed, add a new number rather than renumbering widely.

## 🎓 Learning-Centered Approach

### **Target Audiences**

1. **Beginners** - New to technology, need foundational concepts
2. **Practitioners** - Have some experience, seeking to deepen expertise
3. **Professionals** - Advanced users looking for specialized knowledge
4. **Leaders** - Strategic understanding for decision-making and team guidance

### **Content Adaptation Guidelines**

- Teach for our audiences with clear entry points (Beginner / Practitioner / Professional / Leader).
- Prioritize intuition → mechanics → implementation → evaluation.
- Replace source examples with original ones relevant to STSA contexts.
- Prefer minimal, fresh code over large copied blocks; runnable code lives in external repos when appropriate.
- Maintain a consistent voice and terminology across the knowledge base.

## 📖 Content Creation Protocols

### **When Processing Reference Materials**

1. **Analyze Source Intent**: Understand what the original author is trying to teach
2. **Extract Core Concepts**: Identify the fundamental principles and ideas
3. **Redesign Presentation**: Create new explanations using different examples and analogies
4. **Add Educational Value**: Include exercises, questions, or practical applications
5. **Fit Repository Context**: Ensure content aligns with existing learning progression

### **Quality Assurance Checklist**

- Zero‑copy audit: no sentences, bullet structures, or diagrams mirror a specific source.
- STSA metadata block included and filled (Level, Prereqs, Time, Next Steps).
- Related Topics present (Prereqs / Builds Upon / Enables / Cross‑Refs).
- ASCII diagram provided; Mermaid optional with ASCII fallback.
- Internal links checked; numbering starts at `01_`.
- Code follows STSA single‑source‑of‑truth policy (external repo for runnable code when appropriate).

## 🔗 Integration Requirements

### **Cross-Domain Connections**

Always connect new content to:

- Upstream prerequisites
- Peer topics it builds upon
- Downstream applications it enables
- Adjacent tracks (Development, AI & ML, Data Science)

### **Metadata Requirements**

Each significant content piece should include:

## 🚀 Implementation Guidelines

### **File Creation Standards**

```markdown
# [Sequential Number]\_[Descriptive Title]

**Learning Level**: [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced]  
**Prerequisites**: [List required knowledge]  
**Estimated Time**: [X minutes/hours]

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this content, you will:

## 📋 Content Sections

### Conceptual Foundation

### Practical Examples

### Implementation Guide

### Common Pitfalls

### Next Steps

## 🔗 Related Topics
```

### **README File Standards**

Each domain folder must include a concise README with:

- Purpose and scope
- Learning level and prerequisites
- Local navigation and Related Topics
- Last Updated date

## 🎨 Creative Content Guidelines

### **Encouraged Approaches**

- New analogies, scenarios, datasets, and step‑by‑step builds
- Short, fresh code to illustrate ideas; runnable code lives in external repos
- Progressive exercises and self‑checks
- Clear pitfalls and trade‑offs tailored to real practice

### **Prohibited Practices**

- Copying or lightly paraphrasing third‑party text
- Reusing a source’s outline, headings, or example flow
- Embedding third‑party images/figures; do not trace
- Copy‑pasting code from incompatible licenses or without transformation/attribution
- Referencing proprietary content without permission

### Citations & Quotations

- Prefer no direct quotations. If unavoidable, use brief, clearly quoted snippets with a link.
- Summaries must be in our own words and structure; do not mimic phrasing.

**🔍 Quality Check**: If you can trace any phrase, structure, or example back to a specific source, it needs to be completely reimagined using original presentation methods.

## 🔍 Content Review Process

### **Self-Assessment Questions**

Before finalizing any content, ask:

1. Is this explanation clearer than the source material?
2. Does this fit naturally in the learning progression?
3. Would a learner understand this without the original source?
4. Are the examples relevant and practical?
5. Does this content add educational value beyond the reference?

### ✅ Publication Gate (must pass all)

- [ ] Zero‑copy verified (no phrase/structure resemblance)
- [ ] Original examples and visuals
- [ ] STSA metadata present and accurate
- [ ] Related Topics wired and links valid
- [ ] Numbering and casing consistent

### **Continuous Improvement**

## 📊 Success Metrics

Content quality should be measured by:

**🎯 Remember**: The goal is not to reproduce existing content, but to create superior educational experiences that help learners master complex technical concepts through structured, progressive learning paths.

**Last Review**: August 26, 2025  
**Next Review**: Every 3 months or when significant changes are made  
**Maintained By**: Swamy's Tech Skills Academy Learning System

Note: Prefer ASCII-first diagrams for universal preview. Mermaid diagrams may be included as an optional enhancement when an ASCII fallback is present.

## 📝 Markdown Authoring & Linting Standards (STSA)

Follow these rules to keep Markdown clean, consistent, and lint-safe across the repo.

### Core rules

- Use spaces only — no hard tabs anywhere (MD010)
- Nested list indentation is two spaces per level (MD007)
  - Example:
    - Parent item
      - Child item
      - Another child
- Always specify a language for fenced code blocks (MD040)
- Surround headings, lists, and code fences with a blank line (MD022/MD032/MD031)
- Avoid trailing spaces (use two spaces only when you intentionally want a line break)
- Prefer hyphens (-) for unordered lists; use numeric lists as 1., 2., 3. or just 1. auto-number consistently
- Keep line length reasonable (~120 chars); tables/URLs may exceed
- Wrap file names, paths, and inline code in backticks
- Emojis are fine; keep them minimal and meaningful

Supported fence languages commonly used here:

- text (ASCII diagrams)
- bash (POSIX shell)
- powershell (Windows pwsh)
- json, yaml, python, ts, js, csharp

Example code fence with required blank lines:

```text
[Service A]
  ↓ calls
[Service B]
```

### Tables

- Include a header row and separator line
- Use spaces, not tabs; keep columns concise
- Align pipes consistently; avoid trailing spaces at row ends

### Diagrams

- Provide ASCII-first diagrams using text code fences
- Optional: add Mermaid only if an ASCII fallback is present

### Pre-publish lint checklist

- No tabs; two-space nested list indentation
- All fenced code blocks have a language
- Headings/lists/code fences separated by blank lines
- Preview in VS Code Markdown preview to check rendering

## 🧭 Code Single-Source-of-Truth Policy (STSA)

- Example (One-Hot Encoding): [Swamy-s-Tech-Skills-Academy-AI-ML-Data/llm-agents-learning](https://github.com/Swamy-s-Tech-Skills-Academy-AI-ML-Data/llm-agents-learning)
- Curated concept pages (ReferenceLibrary)
- Evidence and outcomes (LeadArchitectKnowledgeBase)
- Capture-only notes (LearningJourney/Notes)
- On user request, generate minimal runnable code and (preferred) create or use a new external GitHub repo for that concept/date; then link to it.
- Only place code in this repo if explicitly asked. Mark it as temporary, and when an external repo is created later, migrate the code and update links; remove the local duplicate.
