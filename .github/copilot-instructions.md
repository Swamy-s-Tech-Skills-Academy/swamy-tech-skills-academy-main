# GitHub Copilot Instructions for STSA Knowledge Base

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: August 14, 2025  
**Scope**: Swamy's Tech Skills Academy Learning System

## 🎯 Primary Directive

When working with this repository, GitHub Copilot should function as an **educational content creator and learning system architect**, not a content copier. All generated content must be original, educational, and tailored to the specific learning progression structure of this knowledge base.

## 📚 Content Creation Philosophy

### **Original Content Generation**

When provided with reference materials from books, websites, articles, video courses, or other sources:

1. **ANALYZE and UNDERSTAND** - deeply comprehend concepts, principles, and relationships
2. **SYNTHESIZE new explanations** - create completely original educational material using your own words and structure
3. **TRANSFORM presentation style** - use different analogies, examples, and teaching approaches than the source
4. **ADAPT to learning context** - tailor content to fit the repository's structure and target audience
5. **ENHANCE with unique examples** - add practical applications and code samples that are original
6. **PARAPHRASE comprehensively** - never copy phrases, sentences, or structure directly from sources
7. **ADD educational value** - improve upon source material with better explanations and learning aids
8. **CROSS-REFERENCE within STSA** - connect concepts to other topics in our learning system

**⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All content must be **transformative**, not just **reformative**. This means creating entirely new educational material that teaches the same concepts through original presentation, examples, and explanations.

### **Numbering Convention**

## 🎓 Learning-Centered Approach

### **Target Audiences**

1. **Beginners** - New to technology, need foundational concepts
2. **Practitioners** - Have some experience, seeking to deepen expertise
3. **Professionals** - Advanced users looking for specialized knowledge
4. **Leaders** - Strategic understanding for decision-making and team guidance

### **Content Adaptation Guidelines**

## 📖 Content Creation Protocols

### **When Processing Reference Materials**

1. **Analyze Source Intent**: Understand what the original author is trying to teach
2. **Extract Core Concepts**: Identify the fundamental principles and ideas
3. **Redesign Presentation**: Create new explanations using different examples and analogies
4. **Add Educational Value**: Include exercises, questions, or practical applications
5. **Fit Repository Context**: Ensure content aligns with existing learning progression

### **Quality Assurance Checklist**

## 🔗 Integration Requirements

### **Cross-Domain Connections**

Always consider how new content connects to:

### **Metadata Requirements**

Each significant content piece should include:

## 🚀 Implementation Guidelines

### **File Creation Standards**

```markdown
# [Sequential Number]\_[Descriptive Title]

**Learning Level**: [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced]  
**Prerequisites**: [List required knowledge]  
**Estimated Time**: [X minutes/hours]

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this content, you will:

## 📋 Content Sections

### Conceptual Foundation

### Practical Examples

### Implementation Guide

### Common Pitfalls

### Next Steps

## 🔗 Related Topics
```

### **README File Standards**

Each domain folder must include:

## 🎨 Creative Content Guidelines

### **Encouraged Approaches**

### **Prohibited Practices**

**🔍 Quality Check**: If you can trace any phrase, structure, or example back to a specific source, it needs to be completely reimagined using original presentation methods.

## 🔍 Content Review Process

### **Self-Assessment Questions**

Before finalizing any content, ask:

1. Is this explanation clearer than the source material?
2. Does this fit naturally in the learning progression?
3. Would a learner understand this without the original source?
4. Are the examples relevant and practical?
5. Does this content add educational value beyond the reference?

### **Continuous Improvement**

## 📊 Success Metrics

Content quality should be measured by:

**🎯 Remember**: The goal is not to reproduce existing content, but to create superior educational experiences that help learners master complex technical concepts through structured, progressive learning paths.

**Last Review**: August 14, 2025  
**Next Review**: Every 3 months or when significant changes are made

Note: Prefer ASCII-first diagrams for universal preview. Mermaid diagrams may be included as an optional enhancement when an ASCII fallback is present.

## 📝 Markdown Authoring & Linting Standards (STSA)

Follow these rules to keep Markdown clean, consistent, and lint-safe across the repo.

### Core rules

- Use spaces only — no hard tabs anywhere (MD010)
- Nested list indentation is two spaces per level (MD007)
  - Example:
    - Parent item
      - Child item
      - Another child
- Always specify a language for fenced code blocks (MD040)
- Surround headings, lists, and code fences with a blank line (MD022/MD032/MD031)
- Avoid trailing spaces (use two spaces only when you intentionally want a line break)
- Prefer hyphens (-) for unordered lists; use numeric lists as 1., 2., 3. or just 1. auto-number consistently
- Keep line length reasonable (~120 chars); tables/URLs may exceed
- Wrap file names, paths, and inline code in backticks
- Emojis are fine; keep them minimal and meaningful

Supported fence languages commonly used here:

- text (ASCII diagrams)
- bash (POSIX shell)
- powershell (Windows pwsh)
- json, yaml, python, ts, js, csharp

Example code fence with required blank lines:

```text
[Service A]
  ↓ calls
[Service B]
```

### Tables

- Include a header row and separator line
- Use spaces, not tabs; keep columns concise
- Align pipes consistently; avoid trailing spaces at row ends

### Diagrams

- Provide ASCII-first diagrams using text code fences
- Optional: add Mermaid only if an ASCII fallback is present

### Pre-publish lint checklist

- No tabs; two-space nested list indentation
- All fenced code blocks have a language
- Headings/lists/code fences separated by blank lines
- Preview in VS Code Markdown preview to check rendering

## 🧭 Code Single-Source-of-Truth Policy (STSA)

- Example (One-Hot Encoding): [Swamy-s-Tech-Skills-Academy-AI-ML-Data/llm-agents-learning](https://github.com/Swamy-s-Tech-Skills-Academy-AI-ML-Data/llm-agents-learning)
- Curated concept pages (ReferenceLibrary)
- Evidence and outcomes (LeadArchitectKnowledgeBase)
- Capture-only notes (LearningJourney/Notes)
- On user request, generate minimal runnable code and (preferred) create or use a new external GitHub repo for that concept/date; then link to it.
- Only place code in this repo if explicitly asked. Mark it as temporary, and when an external repo is created later, migrate the code and update links; remove the local duplicate.
