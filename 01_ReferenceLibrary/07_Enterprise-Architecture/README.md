# üèõÔ∏è Enterprise Architecture Track

## Strategic Architecture, Domain Design, and System Integration

**Purpose**: Master enterprise-scale architecture, capability mapping, and strategic technology decisions  
**Target Audience**: Enterprise architects, solution architects, technical directors, CTO-track leaders  
**Learning Level**: Advanced to Expert  
**Prerequisites**: System design fundamentals, development experience, business domain knowledge

---

## üéØ Track Overview

Enterprise architecture bridges business strategy and technology execution. This track covers capability-based planning, domain-driven design at portfolio scale, integration patterns, reference architectures, and architecture governance‚Äîenabling you to lead transformational initiatives and align technology with business outcomes.

### **Why Enterprise Architecture Matters**

- **Strategic Alignment**: Technology decisions must serve business goals and drive value
- **Complexity Management**: Large organizations require coherent architecture across diverse systems
- **Innovation Enablement**: Good architecture accelerates change; poor architecture blocks it
- **Cost Optimization**: Architecture decisions have multi-year financial and operational impact
- **Career Apex**: Enterprise architecture is a key stepping stone to CTO and executive leadership
