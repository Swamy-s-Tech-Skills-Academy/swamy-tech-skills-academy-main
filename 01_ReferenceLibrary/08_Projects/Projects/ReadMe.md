# 🚀 Projects

This folder contains hands-on projects and Proof-of-Concept (PoC) implementations to practice Lead Architect skills.

## 📌 Project Ideas

1. **Microservices with .NET 8 & Azure**
   - Implement a simple e-commerce platform with multiple microservices
   - Use Azure Container Apps or Kubernetes for hosting
   - Implement patterns like API Gateway, CQRS, and Event Sourcing

2. **AI-Powered Chatbot using Azure OpenAI**

3. **Serverless Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Build an end-to-end data processing workflow
   - Utilize Azure Functions, Event Grid, and Cosmos DB
   - Implement monitoring and observability

## 📂 Structure

Each project should have its own folder with:

- `README.md` - Project overview, architecture, and setup instructions
- `docs/` - Detailed documentation including ADRs
- `src/` - Source code
- `infra/` - Infrastructure as Code files (Bicep/ARM/Terraform)

## 🔁 Process

1. Start with an architecture design document
2. Implement a minimum viable product (MVP)
3. Document lessons learned
4. Refine based on new knowledge
