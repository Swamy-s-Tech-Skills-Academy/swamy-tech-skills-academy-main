## Purpose

This folder provides structured navigation through the Lead Architect Knowledge Base, organizing learning content by topic and ensuring comprehensive coverage of all knowledge areas.

## Current Contents

- **Purpose**: Ensures systematic coverage of all 8 knowledge areas
- **Structure**: Week-by-week breakdown linking to specific files
- **Usage**: Reference for understanding learning path organization
- **Scope**: Complete 16-week curriculum mapping

## Knowledge vs Action Separation

**Knowledge Base (this location)**: Static reference materials, curriculum organization, and learning resource navigation.

**Learning Journey** (`/LearningJourney/`): Active learning activities, daily tracking, weekly planning, and progress monitoring.

## Navigation

For active learning and progress tracking, use:

- `../../LearningJourney/Week-01-Learning-Journey.md` - Current active learning
- `../../LearningJourney/README.md` - Learning system overview

For knowledge reference and curriculum understanding, use:

- `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_COVERAGE_MAP.md` - Complete curriculum mapping
- `../ReadMe.md` - Foundation knowledge area overview

## Legacy Note

Action-oriented files (trackers, daily plans, start guides) have been moved to `/LearningJourney/_Archive/LegacyArchitectsJourney/` to maintain clear separation between knowledge resources and active learning activities.
