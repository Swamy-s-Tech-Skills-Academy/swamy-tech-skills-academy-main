## üìö Learning Path (27 Minutes)

### Quick Overview (5 minutes)

Cloud computing has transformed how organizations design, deploy, and scale applications. Understanding core concepts enables strategic technology decisions at enterprise scale.

### Core Concepts (15 minutes)

#### 1. Cloud Service Models

##### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- Virtual machines, storage, networking
- Maximum control, shared responsibility
- Examples: Azure VMs, AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine

##### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- Application runtime, middleware, services
- Focus on code, reduced infrastructure management
- Examples: Azure App Service, Heroku, Google App Engine

##### Software as a Service (SaaS)

- Complete applications delivered over internet
- Minimal technical management required
- Examples: Microsoft 365, Salesforce, GitHub

##### Serverless Computing

- Event-driven, automatic scaling
- Pay-per-execution model
- Examples: Azure Functions, AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions

#### 2. Core Cloud Services

##### Compute Services

- Virtual machines for legacy applications
- Containers for microservices architectures
- Functions for event-driven processing
- Managed Kubernetes for orchestration

##### Storage Solutions

- Object storage for unstructured data
- File shares for traditional applications
- Database services for structured data
- Backup and archival solutions

##### Networking Components

- Virtual networks for isolation
- Load balancers for high availability
- Content delivery networks for performance
- VPN and private connections

### Architecture Patterns (5 minutes)

#### Microservices Architecture

- Decomposed applications into small services
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Technology diversity and team autonomy

#### Event-Driven Systems

- Loose coupling through messaging
- Reactive and resilient architectures
- Real-time processing capabilities

#### Hybrid Cloud Patterns

- On-premises and cloud integration
- Workload portability strategies
- Compliance and data residency

### Key Takeaways & Next Steps (2 minutes)

**Essential Principles:**

- Choose service models based on control vs. convenience trade-offs
- Design for resilience, scalability, and security from the start
- Consider multi-cloud strategies for vendor independence
- Implement proper monitoring and cost management

**Next Learning Steps:**

- Deep dive into specific cloud providers (Azure, AWS, GCP)
- Explore Infrastructure as Code implementation
- Study cloud security architecture patterns
- Learn FinOps for cost optimization
