# DevOps (Legacy Placeholder Index)

This legacy folder aggregates DevOps-related materials (CI/CD, containers, observability, IaC, Kubernetes).

Subfolders:
- Docker/
- CI_CD/
- IaC/
- K8s/
- Observability/
- DevOps_Original/

A curated modern set will live under `03_ReferenceLibrary/07_DevOps/` (placeholder created). Until then, this index resolves broken legacy links.
