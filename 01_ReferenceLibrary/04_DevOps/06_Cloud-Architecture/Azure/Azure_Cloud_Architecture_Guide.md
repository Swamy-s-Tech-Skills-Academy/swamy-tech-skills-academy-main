## Core Services Overview

Azure provides a comprehensive set of services for building, deploying, and managing applications in the cloud.

### Resource Management

- **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**: Centralized management service for Azure resources
- **Resource Groups**: Logical containers for resources that share the same lifecycle
- **Azure Bicep**: Domain-specific language for deploying Azure resources
- **Managed Identities**: Authentication service for resources without storing credentials

### Regions & Availability

- **Regions**: Geographic areas containing one or more datacenters
- **Availability Zones**: Physically separate datacenters within a region
- **Region Pairs**: Geographically paired regions for disaster recovery
- **Sovereign Clouds**: Isolated Azure instances for compliance (US Gov, China, etc.)

## Architectural Patterns

Common architectural patterns for Azure applications:

### Web Applications

- **Multi-tier Web Application**:
  - Front-end tier (App Service)
  - Middle tier (API Apps, Functions)
  - Data tier (SQL Database, Cosmos DB)

### Microservices

- **Azure Container Apps**: Managed Kubernetes environment for microservices
- **Service Fabric**: Platform for packaging, deploying, and managing microservices
- **Event-driven architecture** using Event Grid, Service Bus, and Event Hubs

### Serverless

- **Azure Functions**: Event-driven, serverless compute
- **Logic Apps**: Workflow automation with minimal code
- **Event-driven processing** using triggers and bindings

### Big Data & Analytics

- **Modern Data Warehouse**: Combine structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data
- **Lambda Architecture**: Handle batch and real-time data processing
- **Kappa Architecture**: Simplify by treating everything as a stream

## Service Categories

### Compute

- **Virtual Machines**: IaaS offering for maximum control
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: Managed Kubernetes for container orchestration
- **App Service**: PaaS offering for web applications and APIs
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless compute for event-driven applications
- **Container Apps**: Managed environment for microservices
- **Azure Batch**: Large-scale parallel and batch compute jobs

### Storage

- **Blob Storage**: Unstructured object storage
- **Files**: Fully managed file shares
- **Disks**: Block-level storage volumes for VMs
- **Tables**: NoSQL key-value storage
- **Queues**: Messaging storage for reliable messaging

### Databases

- **Azure SQL Database**: Managed relational database service
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Globally distributed, multi-model database
- **Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL/MariaDB**: Managed open-source databases
- **Azure Cache for Redis**: In-memory data store
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Analytics service for big data and data warehousing

### Networking

- **Virtual Network**: Isolated network for Azure resources
- **Load Balancer**: Network distribution for high availability
- **Application Gateway**: Web traffic load balancer with WAF
- **Front Door**: Global routing service for web applications
- **CDN**: Content delivery network for fast, global content delivery
- **Private Link**: Private connectivity to Azure services
- **ExpressRoute**: Private connections to Azure datacenters

### AI & Machine Learning

- **Azure OpenAI Service**: Advanced language models for applications
- **Azure Cognitive Services**: Pre-built AI services
- **Azure Machine Learning**: End-to-end machine learning platform
- **Azure Bot Service**: Intelligent bot development framework

### Security & Identity

- **Microsoft Entra ID**: Identity and access management service
- **Key Vault**: Secure storage for keys and secrets
- **Security Center**: Security monitoring and management
- **Sentinel**: Cloud-native SIEM service

## Best Practices

### Authentication & Authorization

- Use Managed Identities for Azure resources where possible
- Implement least privilege access with RBAC
- Centralize identity management with Microsoft Entra ID
- Never hardcode credentials; use Key Vault for secrets

### Security

- Enable Azure Defender for all supported resource types
- Implement network security groups and application security groups
- Use private endpoints for services when available
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Regularly review security posture with Secure Score

### Reliability

- Deploy across multiple Availability Zones or regions
- Implement health monitoring and alerting
- Design for graceful degradation
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Use managed services when possible

### Performance

- Leverage caching strategies (Redis, CDN)
- Use autoscaling for variable workloads
- Optimize database queries and indexing
- Consider proximity placement groups for latency-sensitive applications
- Implement asynchronous processing for non-critical operations

### Cost Optimization

- Use Azure Cost Management tools
- Implement resource tagging strategy
- Right-size resources based on actual usage
- Leverage reserved instances for predictable workloads
- Automate scaling to match demand

## Security & Compliance

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: Azure Storage Service Encryption, Transparent Data Encryption
- **Backup**: Azure Backup, Site Recovery
- **Key Management**: Azure Key Vault with HSM support

### Compliance Frameworks

- ISO/IEC 27001
- GDPR
- HIPAA/HITRUST
- PCI DSS
- SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3

### Security Services

- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**: Unified security management
- **Azure DDoS Protection**: Protection against distributed denial-of-service attacks
- **Azure Firewall**: Managed network security service
- **Azure Information Protection**: Document and email classification and protection

## Cost Optimization

### Cost Management Tools

- **Azure Cost Management + Billing**: Monitor, allocate, and optimize cloud costs
- **Azure Advisor**: Recommendations for cost optimization
- **Azure Budgets**: Set spending thresholds and alerts

### Cost Optimization Strategies

- **Right-size resources**: Match resource capacity to workload
- **Reserved Instances**: Discounted rates for 1-3 year commitments
- **Spot Instances**: Use spare capacity at reduced cost
- **Autoscaling**: Scale resources based on demand
- **Lifecycle management**: Automate cleanup of unused resources

## Azure DevOps Integration

### CI/CD Pipelines

- Use Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Implement Infrastructure as Code with ARM templates or Bicep
- Automate testing and deployment
- Implement deployment environments (Dev, Test, Prod)

### Monitoring & Observability

- **Azure Monitor**: Collect, analyze, and act on telemetry
- **Application Insights**: Application performance monitoring
- **Log Analytics**: Analyze and visualize log data
- **Workbooks**: Interactive reports for complex analysis
