The **CAP Theorem**, also known as **Brewer's Theorem**, is a fundamental principle in distributed systems that states:

**In a distributed data system, it is impossible to simultaneously guarantee all three of the following properties:**

1. **Consistency (C)**

   - Every read from the system returns the most recent write or an error.
   - All nodes see the same data at the same time.
   - Example: In a bank, if one node processes a deposit, all other nodes should reflect the updated balance immediately.

2. **Availability (A)**

   - Every request receives a response (either success or failure), even if some nodes are down.
   - The system remains operational for reads and writes despite failures.
   - Example: A web application where every user gets a response regardless of system issues.

3. **Partition Tolerance (P)**
   - The system continues to function despite network partitions (communication breakdowns between nodes).
   - Data may be partitioned across different locations, and the system should tolerate network failures between them.
   - Example: A globally distributed application.

---

### **Implications of CAP Theorem**

- You **cannot achieve all three properties simultaneously** in a distributed system. You must pick two:
  - **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance):**
    - Sacrifices availability.
    - Example: A database that ensures consistency at the cost of being unavailable during network partitions (e.g., HBase, MongoDB in certain configurations).
  - **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance):**
    - Sacrifices consistency.
    - Example: A system that remains operational even if the data might be stale (e.g., DynamoDB, Cassandra).
  - **CA (Consistency + Availability):**
    - Sacrifices partition tolerance (less applicable in distributed systems, since network partitions are inevitable).
    - Example: Traditional relational databases in a single-node setup.

---

### **Visual Representation**

Here’s a Venn diagram to illustrate CAP Theorem:

```

   Consistency (C)
      _______
     |       |
     |       | Availability (A)
     |_______|
       Partition
       Tolerance (P)

```text

Each intersection represents a trade-off.

### **Real-World Examples**

| System Type                                 | Guarantees                                                            | Example Systems                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)**  | Data consistency during partitions, but may sacrifice availability.   | MongoDB (with majority writes), HBase            |
| **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)** | High availability, even with partitions, but eventual consistency.    | DynamoDB, Cassandra                              |
| **CA (Consistency + Availability)**         | Strong consistency and availability, but no tolerance for partitions. | Relational Databases (RDBMS) without replication |

---

### **CAP Theorem in Context**

- Distributed databases like Cassandra, DynamoDB, and MongoDB often prioritize **AP** (eventual consistency) to ensure availability and partition tolerance in global systems.
- Systems requiring financial accuracy (e.g., banking) often lean towards **CP** to ensure consistency, even if it means downtime during network failures.

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), events play a crucial role in capturing the state changes and communication between different parts of the domain model and the system. Here are the **types of events in DDD**:

---

### **1. Domain Events**

- **Definition**: Represent something significant that has happened in the domain.
- **Purpose**:
  - To signal state changes in the domain model.
  - To communicate between aggregates or bounded contexts without tight coupling.
- **Examples**:
  - `OrderPlaced`
  - `PaymentReceived`
  - `UserRegistered`
- **Characteristics**:
  - Immutable.
  - Named using past tense to indicate something has already occurred.

---

### **2. Integration Events**

- **Definition**: Used to communicate between different systems or bounded contexts.
- **Purpose**:
  - To ensure consistency and synchronization across distributed systems.
  - Facilitates **event-driven architecture**.
- **Examples**:
  - `CustomerCreated` (broadcast to other services like CRM, analytics, etc.)
  - `OrderShipped`
- **Characteristics**:
  - Typically processed by external systems.
  - May include additional metadata for integration (e.g., timestamps, correlation IDs).

---

### **3. Application Events**

- **Definition**: Related to the application layer, indicating that something significant occurred within the application context.
- **Purpose**:
  - To trigger application-specific workflows or processes.
  - Orchestrate actions outside the domain (e.g., sending an email).
- **Examples**:
  - `EmailSent`
  - `SMSNotificationTriggered`
- **Characteristics**:
  - Not strictly tied to the domain model.
  - Serve operational needs of the application.

---

### **4. Lifecycle Events**

- **Definition**: Capture events related to the lifecycle of aggregates or entities.
- **Purpose**:
  - To monitor or track the creation, update, and deletion of entities.
- **Examples**:
  - `CustomerActivated`
  - `CustomerDeleted`
- **Characteristics**:
  - Often used for auditing or logging purposes.

---

### **5. Process/Workflow Events**

- **Definition**: Represent events that occur as part of a business process or workflow.
- **Purpose**:
  - To coordinate multiple steps or activities in a process.
  - Drive state machines or sagas.
- **Examples**:
  - `OrderValidated`
  - `InventoryChecked`
- **Characteristics**:
  - Often used in long-running workflows or sagas.

---

### **6. Reactive/UI Events** _(Optional in DDD-specific discussions)_

- **Definition**: Capture interactions in the user interface or reactive layers.
- **Purpose**:
  - To handle events triggered by users or external systems.
- **Examples**:
  - `ButtonClicked`
  - `FileUploaded`
- **Characteristics**:
  - Often considered outside the scope of core DDD but may interact with application events.

---

### Visual Representation (Optional UML Diagram)

To visualize the interaction of these events in a system, you can create a **sequence diagram** in PlantUML:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "Application Layer" as AL
participant "Domain Layer" as DL
participant "External Service" as ES

User -> AL: Triggers an action
AL -> DL: Domain Event (e.g., OrderPlaced)
DL -> AL: Responds to domain event
AL -> ES: Integration Event (e.g., CustomerCreated)

@enduml
```

### Notes

- **Bounded Contexts**: Integration events often cross bounded contexts, while domain events usually stay within their context.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Events are a cornerstone of reactive systems in DDD and help achieve eventual consistency.

Would you like me to elaborate on event handling, storage, or examples in code?
