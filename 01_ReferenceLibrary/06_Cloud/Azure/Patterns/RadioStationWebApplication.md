# Azure Architecture Pattern: Radio Station Web Application

## Overview

This reference architecture demonstrates how to design a scalable, fault-tolerant web application for a radio station using various Azure services. The solution enables broadcasting program schedules across different regions, user interactions through comments, and administrative management.

## Azure Components

### Identity & Authentication

- **Microsoft Entra ID B2C (formerly Azure AD B2C)**
  - Handles user authentication and authorization
  - Supports OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
  - Manages separation between admin and user roles

### Web Application Hosting

- **Azure App Service**
  - Hosts the user-facing and admin web applications
  - Provides scale-out capabilities through App Service Plans
  - Supports CI/CD integration with Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions

### API Management & Networking

- **Azure API Management**
  - Centralized gateway for all API traffic
  - Implements rate limiting, authentication, and routing
  - Provides developer portal and documentation
- **Azure Front Door**
  - Distributes traffic globally
  - Routes users to the nearest healthy endpoints
  - Provides WAF (Web Application Firewall) protection

### Data Storage

- **Azure SQL Database**
  - Stores program schedules and transactional data
  - Configured with auto-failover groups for high availability
  - Geo-replication for disaster recovery
- **Azure Cosmos DB**
  - Stores user comments with high throughput
  - Multi-region writes for low-latency global access
  - Automatic indexing for efficient queries
- **Azure Cache for Redis**
  - Caches live program data for quick retrieval
  - Improves application performance
  - Configurable eviction policies for expired content

### Content Delivery

- **Azure CDN**
  - Delivers static assets globally with low latency
  - Caches program images and web resources
  - Reduces load on origin servers

### Messaging & Integration

- **Azure Event Hubs**
  - Processes streaming data from program status changes
  - Handles high-throughput event ingestion
  - Enables real-time updates when programs end
- **Azure Service Bus**
  - Manages reliable message delivery for critical operations
  - Implements queues and topics for publisher-subscriber patterns
  - Supports dead-letter queues for failed operations

### Analytics & Reporting

- **Azure Synapse Analytics**
  - Processes large-scale analytics on historical program data
  - Generates insights on program popularity and user engagement
  - Supports both data warehousing and big data analytics
- **Power BI**
  - Creates interactive dashboards for program performance
  - Visualizes user demographics and engagement metrics
  - Enables self-service business intelligence for station managers

### Monitoring & Observability

- **Azure Monitor**
  - Provides comprehensive monitoring of all components
  - Configures alerts for performance thresholds and errors
  - Collects metrics, logs, and traces
- **Azure Log Analytics**
  - Centralizes logging from all services
  - Enables complex queries across service boundaries
  - Supports long-term log retention and analysis

## Fault Tolerance Considerations

This architecture emphasizes high availability and fault tolerance:

1. **Application Tier**
   - Multiple App Service instances across regions
   - Automatic scaling based on load
   - Health checks and self-healing

2. **Data Tier**
   - SQL Database with active geo-replication
   - Cosmos DB with multi-region writes
   - Redis Cache in premium tier with replication

3. **Networking**
   - Azure Front Door for global load balancing
   - Traffic Manager for regional failover
   - Private endpoints for secure service communication

4. **Resilience Patterns**
   - Circuit breaker pattern for API calls
   - Retry policies with exponential backoff
   - Graceful degradation during partial outages

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Microsoft Entra ID B2C for identity management
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) for admin functions
   - Token-based authentication for APIs

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption at rest for all data stores
   - TLS 1.2+ for all communications
   - Key Vault for secure secrets management

3. **Network Security**
   - Web Application Firewall (WAF) policies
   - Private Endpoints for PaaS services
   - Network Security Groups (NSGs) for traffic control

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - App Service autoscaling for web tiers
   - Cosmos DB throughput scaling for comments storage
   - Event Hubs auto-inflate for traffic spikes

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Redis caching for frequent queries
   - CDN for static content delivery
   - Read replicas for SQL Database

## Cost Optimization

1. **Consumption-Based Services**
   - App Service scale down during off-hours
   - Cosmos DB autoscale provisioned throughput
   - Redis Cache appropriate tier selection

2. **Reserved Instances**
   - SQL Database reserved capacity for predictable workloads
   - App Service reserved instances for base capacity

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Use Azure Bicep or ARM templates
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure updates
   - Separate dev/test/prod environments

2. **Application Deployment**
   - Blue-green deployment strategy
   - Staged deployment slots in App Service
   - Automated testing in deployment pipeline
