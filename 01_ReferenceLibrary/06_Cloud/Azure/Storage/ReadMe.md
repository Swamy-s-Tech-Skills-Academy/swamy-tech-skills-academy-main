# Azure Storage Services

This folder contains resources, patterns, and best practices for Azure storage services.

## Core Storage Services

### Azure Blob Storage

- Object storage for unstructured data
- Tiered storage (Hot, Cool, Archive)
- Massive scalability with petabyte capacity
- Ideal for media files, backups, data lakes, and static website hosting

### Azure Files

- Fully managed file shares accessible via SMB and NFS protocols
- Cloud or on-premises access
- Eliminates the need to manage file servers
- Ideal for "lift and shift" migrations and shared application settings

### Azure Queue Storage

- Service for storing large numbers of messages
- Enables asynchronous processing between application components
- Provides reliable messaging in the cloud
- Ideal for processing backlogs and handling traffic spikes

### Azure Table Storage

- NoSQL key-attribute store
- Schema-less design for flexibility
- Low cost with high performance
- Ideal for storing structured, non-relational data

### Azure Disk Storage

- Block-level storage volumes for Azure VMs
- Various performance tiers (Standard HDD, Standard SSD, Premium SSD, Ultra Disk)
- Support for managed and unmanaged disks
- Ideal for VM operating systems and application data

## Database Services

### Azure SQL Database

- Fully managed relational database service
- Built on the latest stable SQL Server engine
- High availability and automated backups
- Ideal for modern cloud applications requiring relational data

### Azure Cosmos DB

- Globally distributed, multi-model database service
- Support for multiple APIs (SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table)
- Automatic and instant scalability
- Ideal for globally distributed applications requiring low latency

### Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL/MariaDB

- Fully managed versions of open-source databases
- Built-in high availability and security
- Automated backups and patching
- Ideal for open-source applications requiring relational databases

### Azure Cache for Redis

- In-memory data store based on Redis
- High-throughput, low-latency caching
- Data persistence and replication
- Ideal for application caching, session stores, and real-time analytics

## Data Lake and Analytics

### Azure Data Lake Storage

- Hyperscale repository for big data analytics workloads
- Built on Azure Blob Storage
- Hierarchical namespace for efficient data operations
- Ideal for big data analytics and data science workloads

### Azure Synapse Analytics

- Analytics service that brings together data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics
- Serverless or dedicated resources
- Integrated with Power BI, Azure ML, and Azure Data Factory
- Ideal for enterprise data warehousing and big data processing

## Best Practices

### Data Security

- Implement encryption at rest for all storage services
- Use Azure Private Endpoints to secure storage access
- Implement appropriate access control with SAS tokens and Azure RBAC
- Enable soft delete and versioning for data protection

### Performance Optimization

- Choose the right storage tier based on access patterns
- Use premium storage for I/O-intensive workloads
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Optimize data layout and partitioning for query performance

### Cost Management

- Utilize lifecycle management policies to automatically transition data between tiers
- Implement retention policies to manage data growth
- Use reserved capacity for predictable workloads
- Monitor and right-size database resources

### Resiliency and Availability

- Use zone-redundant or geo-redundant storage for critical data
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff in applications
- Design for eventual consistency when possible
- Use read replicas for read-heavy workloads

## Storage Solution Patterns

### Data Lake Architecture

- Use Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 as the foundation
- Organize data in bronze (raw), silver (processed), and gold (refined) layers
- Implement appropriate security and governance
- Integrate with Azure Synapse Analytics for analytics

### Hybrid Storage Solutions

- Use Azure File Sync to extend on-premises file servers to the cloud
- Implement Azure StorSimple for integrated storage management
- Use Azure Arc-enabled data services for hybrid database management
- Consider Azure Stack HCI for edge storage needs

### Microservices Data Architecture

- Use Cosmos DB for global distribution and multi-model support
- Implement the CQRS pattern with separate read and write models
- Consider event sourcing with Azure Event Hubs and Storage
- Use Azure Cache for Redis for shared state and caching

## Decision Matrix: Choosing the Right Storage Service

| VM disks | Azure Disk Storage |
| Relational data | Azure SQL Database |
| Global NoSQL | Azure Cosmos DB |
| Open-source relational | Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL/MariaDB |
| Caching | Azure Cache for Redis |
| Big data analytics | Azure Data Lake Storage |
| Data warehousing | Azure Synapse Analytics |
