## 🏗️ Organization Principles

### **Numbering Convention**

- **Always use** zero-padded numeric prefixes starting with `01_`
- **Never use** `00_` prefixes - all content starts with `01_` or higher
- **Maintain stability** - preserve existing numbers when possible
- **Batch updates** when renumbering is necessary

### **Content Standards**

- **Educational focus**: Pure learning content only
- **Progressive structure**: Build from foundations to advanced concepts
- **Cross-references**: Clear links between related topics
- **Practical application**: Real-world examples and implementations

### **File Organization**

- **Single source of truth**: One comprehensive README per domain
- **Minimal redundancy**: Avoid duplicate navigation files
- **Clear hierarchy**: Logical folder structure with consistent naming

---

## 💡 Quick Tips for Navigation

### **🎯 Looking for Specific Topics?**

Use the search function or navigate directly to domain folders. Each domain has its own comprehensive README with detailed content maps.

### **🚀 Starting a Learning Journey?**

1. Choose your primary track based on career goals
2. Review the pathway diagram for your chosen track
3. Start with foundations and progress systematically
4. Cross-reference with related domains as needed

### **🔧 Building Real Projects?**

Combine multiple tracks:

- **AI Project**: Development + AI/ML + DevOps
- **Data Project**: Development + Data Science + DevOps  
- **Enterprise System**: Development + DevOps + appropriate domain expertise
