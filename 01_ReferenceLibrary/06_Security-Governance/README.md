# üîê Security & Governance Track

## Zero-Trust Architecture, Compliance, and Risk Management

**Purpose**: Build secure, compliant, and resilient enterprise systems  
**Target Audience**: Security architects, compliance officers, risk managers, technical leads  
**Learning Level**: Intermediate to Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Infrastructure fundamentals, networking basics, identity concepts

---

## üéØ Track Overview

Security and governance are foundational to enterprise architecture. This track covers zero-trust principles, identity and access management, compliance frameworks, threat modeling, and security governance‚Äîenabling you to design systems that protect data, meet regulatory requirements, and manage risk effectively.

### **Why Security & Governance Matter**

- **Business Continuity**: Security incidents disrupt operations and damage reputation
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2 are mandatory for many industries
- **Risk Management**: Proactive security reduces breach probability and impact
- **Architectural Foundation**: Security must be designed in, not bolted on
- **Career Essential**: Security expertise is required for senior architecture roles
