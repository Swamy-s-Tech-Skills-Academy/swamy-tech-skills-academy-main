## üìã Core Concepts

### Class Design and Implementation

```python
class BankAccount:
    """A simple bank account class demonstrating OOP principles."""
    
    # Class variable (shared by all instances)
    bank_name = "Python Bank"
    account_count = 0
    
    def __init__(self, account_holder, initial_balance=0):
        """Initialize a new bank account."""
        self.account_holder = account_holder
        self._balance = initial_balance  # Protected attribute
        self._account_number = self._generate_account_number()
        BankAccount.account_count += 1
    
    def _generate_account_number(self):
        """Private method to generate account number."""
        import random
        return f"ACC{random.randint(10000, 99999)}"
    
    def deposit(self, amount):
        """Deposit money into the account."""
        if amount > 0:
            self._balance += amount
            return f"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self._balance:.2f}"
        return "Deposit amount must be positive"
    
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """Withdraw money from the account."""
        if amount > self._balance:
            return "Insufficient funds"
        if amount > 0:
            self._balance -= amount
            return f"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self._balance:.2f}"
        return "Withdrawal amount must be positive"
    
    @property
    def balance(self):
        """Get current balance (read-only property)."""
        return self._balance
    
    @property
    def account_number(self):
        """Get account number (read-only property)."""
        return self._account_number
    
    def __str__(self):
        """String representation of the account."""
        return f"Account {self._account_number}: {self.account_holder} - ${self._balance:.2f}"
    
    def __repr__(self):
        """Developer-friendly representation."""
        return f"BankAccount('{self.account_holder}', {self._balance})"

# Usage example
account = BankAccount("John Doe", 1000)
print(account.deposit(500))
print(account.withdraw(200))
print(f"Current balance: ${account.balance:.2f}")
```

### Inheritance and Polymorphism

```python
class Vehicle:
    """Base class for all vehicles."""
    
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.is_running = False
    
    def start(self):
        """Start the vehicle."""
        if not self.is_running:
            self.is_running = True
            return f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model} started"
        return "Vehicle is already running"
    
    def stop(self):
        """Stop the vehicle."""
        if self.is_running:
            self.is_running = False
            return f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model} stopped"
        return "Vehicle is already stopped"
    
    def get_info(self):
        """Get vehicle information."""
        status = "running" if self.is_running else "stopped"
        return f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model} ({status})"

class Car(Vehicle):
    """Car class inheriting from Vehicle."""
    
    def __init__(self, make, model, year, fuel_type="gasoline"):
        super().__init__(make, model, year)
        self.fuel_type = fuel_type
        self.doors = 4
    
    def honk(self):
        """Car-specific method."""
        return "Beep beep!"
    
    def get_info(self):
        """Override parent method with additional info."""
        base_info = super().get_info()
        return f"{base_info} - {self.fuel_type}, {self.doors} doors"

class Motorcycle(Vehicle):
    """Motorcycle class inheriting from Vehicle."""
    
    def __init__(self, make, model, year, engine_size):
        super().__init__(make, model, year)
        self.engine_size = engine_size
        self.doors = 0
    
    def wheelie(self):
        """Motorcycle-specific method."""
        if self.is_running:
            return "Performing wheelie!"
        return "Cannot perform wheelie - motorcycle not running"
    
    def get_info(self):
        """Override parent method with additional info."""
        base_info = super().get_info()
        return f"{base_info} - {self.engine_size}cc engine"

# Polymorphism demonstration
vehicles = [
    Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022, "hybrid"),
    Motorcycle("Honda", "CBR600", 2021, 600),
    Car("Tesla", "Model 3", 2023, "electric")
]

for vehicle in vehicles:
    print(vehicle.start())
    print(vehicle.get_info())
    print("-" * 40)
```
