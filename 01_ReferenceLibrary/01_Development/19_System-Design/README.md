# System Design Fundamentals

**Learning Level**: Professional
**Estimated Time**: 27 minutes (read)
**Prerequisites**: Software Design Principles, Data Structures & Algorithms

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. This module provides foundational knowledge for designing scalable, reliable, and maintainable software systems.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

1. **Core Concepts**: Scalability, reliability, latency vs throughput
2. **Building Blocks**: Load balancers, caches, queues, databases
3. **Data Strategies**: Sharding, replication, consistency models
4. **Design Methodology**: Structured approach to system design
5. **Trade-off Analysis**: Making informed architectural decisions
