# 🏛️ Architecture Patterns Reference Library

## System-Level Design Solutions for Enterprise Applications

---

## 🏗️ **Purpose**

This folder contains **architectural patterns** - high-level structural solutions that define the overall organization of software systems. These patterns implement the architectural principles (from folder 06) in concrete, reusable ways. While design patterns solve object-level problems, architectural patterns address system-wide concerns like separation of concerns, scalability, maintainability, and user interface organization.

## 📚 **Core Architecture Patterns**

### **🎯 MVC - Model-View-Controller**

**Purpose**: Separate user interface from business logic

#### Components — MVC

- **Model**: Data and business logic
- **View**: User interface and presentation
- **Controller**: Handles user input and coordinates Model/View

#### Benefits — MVC
