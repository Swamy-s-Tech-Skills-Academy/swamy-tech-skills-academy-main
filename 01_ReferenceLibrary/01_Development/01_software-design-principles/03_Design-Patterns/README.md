# 🛠️ Design Patterns Reference Library

## Proven Solutions to Common Programming Problems

---

## 🏗️ **Purpose**

This folder contains **design patterns** - time-tested solutions to recurring design problems in software development. While design principles tell you HOW to think about code, design patterns provide specific SOLUTIONS you can implement. Each pattern addresses a particular problem and provides a template for solving it.

### **🔗 Structural Patterns**

**Purpose**: Compose objects and classes into larger structures

#### **Adapter Pattern**

- **Problem**: Integrate incompatible interfaces
- **Solution**: Create wrapper that translates between interfaces
- **When to Use**: Legacy system integration, third-party library compatibility

#### **Decorator Pattern**

- **Problem**: Add behavior to objects without altering structure
- **Solution**: Wrap objects in decorator classes that extend functionality
- **When to Use**: Feature enhancement, cross-cutting concerns, flexible behavior

#### **Facade Pattern**

- **Problem**: Simplify complex subsystem interfaces
- **Solution**: Provide unified, simplified interface to complex systems
- **When to Use**: API simplification, legacy system abstraction

---

### **🎭 Behavioral Patterns**

**Purpose**: Define communication between objects and assignment of responsibilities

#### **Observer Pattern**

- **Problem**: Notify multiple objects about state changes
- **Solution**: Define subscription mechanism for state change notifications
- **When to Use**: Event handling, MVC architectures, reactive systems

#### **Strategy Pattern**

- **Problem**: Select algorithm at runtime
- **Solution**: Define family of algorithms, make them interchangeable
- **When to Use**: Multiple ways to perform task, conditional logic elimination

#### **Command Pattern**

- **Problem**: Encapsulate requests as objects
- **Solution**: Turn requests into objects with execute methods
- **When to Use**: Undo/redo functionality, queuing operations, macro recording

---

### **🏢 Modern Enterprise Patterns**

**Purpose**: Address enterprise application challenges

#### **Repository Pattern**

- **Problem**: Abstract data access logic
- **Solution**: Encapsulate database operations behind interface
- **When to Use**: Data access abstraction, testing with mock data

#### **Unit of Work Pattern**

- **Problem**: Maintain transaction consistency across repositories
- **Solution**: Track changes and coordinate transaction commits
- **When to Use**: Complex business transactions, database operation coordination

## 🎯 **Pattern Selection Guide**

### **Decision Framework**

1. **Identify the Problem**: What specific challenge are you facing?
2. **Match the Pattern**: Which pattern addresses this type of problem?
3. **Consider Context**: Does your situation fit the pattern's use cases?
4. **Evaluate Trade-offs**: What complexity does the pattern add?

### **Common Problem → Pattern Mapping**

| **Problem**                 | **Recommended Pattern** |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Complex object creation     | Builder                 |
| Runtime algorithm selection | Strategy                |
| Interface compatibility     | Adapter                 |
| State change notifications  | Observer                |
| Add behavior dynamically    | Decorator               |
| Simplify complex API        | Facade                  |
| Encapsulate operations      | Command                 |

## ⚠️ **Pattern Anti-Patterns**

### **Common Mistakes**

- **Over-Engineering**: Using patterns when simple solutions work better
- **Cargo Cult Programming**: Using patterns without understanding their purpose
- **Pattern Obsession**: Forcing patterns where they don't fit naturally

### **Guidelines**

- **Start Simple**: Apply patterns only when complexity justifies them
- **Understand Purpose**: Know WHY you're using a pattern, not just HOW
- **Consider Alternatives**: Sometimes a simple function is better than a pattern

---
