# 10_Design-Patterns-Part5-Strategy-Pattern

**Learning Level**: Intermediate  
**Prerequisites**: Basic OOP, SOLID Principles, Factory Pattern  
**Estimated Time**: Complete 4-part series - 2 hours total  

## 🎯 Purpose

The **Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This behavioral pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

**Core Problem Solved**: Avoiding large conditional statements and enabling runtime algorithm selection.

## 🎯 When to Use Strategy Pattern

### **✅ Use Strategy When:**

- You have multiple ways to perform the same task
- You need to switch algorithms at runtime
- You want to avoid complex conditional logic
- Different clients need different algorithm variants

### **❌ Avoid Strategy When:**

- You only have one algorithm
- The algorithms are unlikely to change
- The overhead of additional classes isn't justified

## 🔄 Common Strategy Pattern Applications

1. **Payment Processing** - Multiple payment gateways
2. **Data Validation** - Different validation rules
3. **Sorting Algorithms** - Performance vs memory trade-offs
4. **Compression** - Different compression algorithms
5. **Authentication** - OAuth, SAML, basic auth
6. **Business Rules** - Industry-specific compliance
