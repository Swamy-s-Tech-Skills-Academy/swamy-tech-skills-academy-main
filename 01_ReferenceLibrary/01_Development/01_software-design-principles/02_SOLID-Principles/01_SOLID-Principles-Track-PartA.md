## 🔍 SOLID Principles Breakdown

### **🎯 S - Single Responsibility Principle**

**Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change.

**Generic Concept**: Each class should focus on a single concern or responsibility.

**Bad Example**:

```text
UserManager class that:
- Validates user data
- Saves to database  
- Sends email notifications
- Generates reports
```

**Good Example**:

```text
UserValidator - validates user data
UserRepository - saves to database
EmailService - sends notifications  
ReportGenerator - generates reports
```

**C# Implementation Focus**:

- Separate concerns using multiple classes
- Use dependency injection for loose coupling
- Apply single responsibility to methods and properties

**Python Implementation Focus**:

- Use composition over large classes
- Leverage modules for separation of concerns
- Apply single responsibility to functions and classes

### **🔓 O - Open/Closed Principle**

**Definition**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Generic Concept**: Add new functionality without changing existing code.

**Implementation Strategies**:

- **Inheritance**: Extend base classes
- **Composition**: Use interfaces and dependency injection
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable algorithms

**C# Implementation Focus**:

- Abstract classes and interfaces
- Generics for type-safe extension
- Extension methods for existing types

**Python Implementation Focus**:

- Duck typing for flexible extension
- Composition with protocol classes
- Decorator pattern for behavior extension

### **🔄 L - Liskov Substitution Principle**

**Definition**: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

**Generic Concept**: Subclasses should enhance, not reduce, base class capabilities.

**Violation Examples**:

- Derived class throws exceptions base class doesn't
- Derived class has stricter preconditions
- Derived class has weaker postconditions

**C# Implementation Focus**:

- Proper virtual/override usage
- Interface contracts and documentation
- Generic constraints for type safety

**Python Implementation Focus**:

- Proper inheritance with super()
- Protocol compliance and duck typing
- Abstract base classes for contracts

### **🔌 I - Interface Segregation Principle**

**Definition**: Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use.

**Generic Concept**: Create small, focused interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones.

**Bad Example**:

```text
IWorker interface with:
- Work()
- Eat()
- Sleep()
```

**Good Example**:

```text
IWorkable - Work()
IFeedable - Eat()  
IRestable - Sleep()
```

**C# Implementation Focus**:

- Multiple small interfaces
- Interface composition
- Generic interfaces for flexibility

**Python Implementation Focus**:

- Protocol classes for implicit interfaces
- Mix-in classes for shared behavior
- Composition over large interfaces
