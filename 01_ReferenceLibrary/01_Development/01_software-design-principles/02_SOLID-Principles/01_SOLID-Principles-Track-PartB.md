### **üîª D - Dependency Inversion Principle**

**Definition**: High-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

**Generic Concept**: Depend on interfaces/abstractions, not concrete implementations.

**Implementation Strategies**:

- Dependency injection
- Inversion of Control (IoC) containers
- Factory patterns

**C# Implementation Focus**:

- Built-in DI container usage
- Interface-based design
- Constructor injection patterns

**Python Implementation Focus**:

- Dependency injection frameworks
- Protocol-based abstractions
- Composition and factory patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Projects

### **Beginner Project: E-Commerce Order System**

Refactor a monolithic order processing system to follow SOLID principles:

```text
Before (SOLID violations):
OrderProcessor class:
- Validates orders
- Calculates pricing
- Processes payments
- Sends notifications
- Updates inventory
```

```text
After (SOLID compliant):
OrderValidator - validates orders (SRP)
PricingCalculator - calculates pricing (SRP)
PaymentProcessor - processes payments (SRP) 
NotificationService - sends notifications (SRP)
InventoryManager - updates inventory (SRP)

All depend on abstractions (DIP)
Each has focused interface (ISP)
Extensible without modification (OCP)
Proper substitution hierarchy (LSP)
```

### **Intermediate Project: Reporting System**

Design a flexible reporting system:

- Multiple data sources (database, API, files)
- Multiple output formats (PDF, Excel, HTML)
- Multiple delivery methods (email, save, display)
- Configurable report templates

### **Advanced Project: Plugin Architecture**

Create a plugin-based application framework:

- Dynamic plugin loading
- Plugin lifecycle management
- Inter-plugin communication
- Version compatibility handling

## üìã Daily Practice Templates

### **SRP Daily Exercise**

1. Find a class with multiple responsibilities
2. Extract separate classes for each responsibility
3. Implement in both C# and Python
4. Compare language-specific approaches

### **OCP Daily Exercise**

1. Start with a basic calculator
2. Add new operations without modifying existing code
3. Use different extension mechanisms in each language

### **LSP Daily Exercise**

1. Create a shape hierarchy
2. Ensure all shapes work interchangeably
3. Test substitution scenarios
4. Identify and fix LSP violations

### **ISP Daily Exercise**

1. Design a large interface
2. Break it into smaller, focused interfaces
3. Implement using composition
4. Compare C# interfaces vs Python protocols

### **DIP Daily Exercise**

1. Create a tightly coupled system
2. Introduce abstractions
3. Implement dependency injection
4. Test with different implementations

## üß™ Code Review Checklist

### **SOLID Compliance Check**

- [ ] **SRP**: Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility
- [ ] **OCP**: New features added through extension, not modification
- [ ] **LSP**: All derived classes work as drop-in replacements
- [ ] **ISP**: Interfaces are small and client-specific
- [ ] **DIP**: Dependencies point toward abstractions

### **Language-Specific Implementation**

- [ ] **C#**: Proper use of interfaces, generics, and DI patterns
- [ ] **Python**: Appropriate use of protocols, composition, and duck typing
- [ ] **Generic**: Principles applied consistently across languages
