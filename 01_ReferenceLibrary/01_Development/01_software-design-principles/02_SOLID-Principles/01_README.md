# 🏛️ SOLID Principles - Enterprise Design Foundation

**Learning Level**: Intermediate  
**Prerequisites**: [01_OOP-fundamentals](../01_OOP-fundamentals/) - Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism  
**Estimated Time**: 5-7 hours comprehensive mastery  

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

- Master all five SOLID principles with practical implementations
- Apply Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion principles
- Identify and refactor SOLID violations in existing codebases
- Design maintainable, extensible software architectures
- Implement SOLID principles across multiple programming languages
**Strategic Purpose**: Enterprise-grade design principles for Lead Architect excellence

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This domain contains the **five fundamental SOLID principles** that form the backbone of maintainable, extensible software architecture. These principles are essential for any Lead Architect designing enterprise systems that must evolve and scale.

**SOLID Acronym**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
