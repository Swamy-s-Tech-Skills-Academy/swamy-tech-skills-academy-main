**Architectural Patterns**: Proven solutions and system design

- Recognize and apply common design patterns
- Understand enterprise architectural patterns
- Design scalable and maintainable systems

### **Advanced Layer (Domains 5-6)**

**Principles & Context**: Advanced concepts and domain alignment

- Apply sophisticated design principles (DRY, YAGNI, Law of Demeter)
- Understand domain-driven design and bounded contexts
- Align technical architecture with business domains

### **Strategic Layer (Domains 7-9)**

**Leadership & Governance**: Human and system perspectives

- Design for human experience and accessibility
- Understand organizational impact on architecture (Conway's Law)
- Establish architecture evaluation and governance frameworks

### **Communication Layer (Domain 10)**

**Visual Architecture**: UML and documentation mastery

- Master visual communication of architectural concepts
- Document complex systems for technical and business stakeholders
- Bridge communication gaps between teams and domains

## ðŸ”— Cross-Domain Integration

**Development Languages**: Apply these principles in Python, C#, Java, JavaScript, etc.  
**AI & ML Projects**: Use design principles for ML pipeline architecture  
**Data Science**: Apply patterns to data processing and analytics systems  
**DevOps**: Integrate principles into CI/CD and infrastructure design

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics

**Beginner â†’ Practitioner**: Can identify and apply basic OOP and SOLID principles  
**Practitioner â†’ Professional**: Recognizes patterns and designs maintainable systems  
**Professional â†’ Leader**: Makes architecture decisions considering business context  
**Leader â†’ Architect**: Establishes governance frameworks and guides multiple teams
