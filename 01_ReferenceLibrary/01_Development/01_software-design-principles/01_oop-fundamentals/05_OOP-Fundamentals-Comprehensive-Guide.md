## 🚀 Quick Overview (5 minutes)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around **objects** rather than actions and data rather than logic. Since its introduction in the 1960s with Simula, OOP has become the foundation of modern software development.

### Why OOP Matters for Lead Architects

As a Lead Architect, understanding OOP isn't just about writing code—it's about designing systems that can evolve, scale, and maintain quality at enterprise levels. The four pillars of OOP provide the architectural foundation for building maintainable, extensible software systems.

## 🏗️ Core Concepts (15 minutes)

### The Four Pillars of OOP

OOP is built on four fundamental principles that work together to create robust, maintainable code:

#### 1. **Encapsulation** - Data Protection & Modularity

**Definition**: Encapsulation bundles data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), while controlling access to that data through well-defined interfaces.

**Why it matters**: Prevents external code from directly manipulating an object's internal state, reducing bugs and making code more maintainable.

**Real-World Example**: A bank account class encapsulates the balance and provides controlled access through deposit() and withdraw() methods.

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):
        self.__balance = initial_balance  # Private attribute

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount
            return True
        return False

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
            return True
        return False

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

# Usage - external code can't directly modify balance
account = BankAccount(1000)
account.deposit(500)  # ✅ Controlled access
# account.__balance = -1000  # ❌ Not allowed (would break encapsulation)
```

#### 2. **Abstraction** - Hiding Complexity

**Definition**: Abstraction focuses on showing only essential features while hiding implementation details.

**Why it matters**: Simplifies complex systems by providing clean interfaces that users can interact with without understanding internal complexity.

**Real-World Example**: When you drive a car, you use the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift (abstraction) without needing to understand the internal combustion engine or transmission mechanics.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class DatabaseConnection(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def connect(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def execute_query(self, query):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def close(self):
        pass

# Users work with this clean interface
# Implementation details (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) are hidden
```

#### 3. **Inheritance** - Code Reuse & Relationships

**Definition**: Inheritance allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent/superclass), establishing IS-A relationships.

**Why it matters**: Promotes code reuse, establishes clear hierarchies, and enables polymorphism.

**Real-World Example**: A Car IS-A Vehicle. All vehicles have common properties (speed, direction) and behaviors (start, stop), but cars have additional specific features.

```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.speed = 0

    def start(self):
        print(f"{self.make} {self.model} starting...")

    def stop(self):
        self.speed = 0
        print(f"{self.make} {self.model} stopped.")

class Car(Vehicle):  # Car IS-A Vehicle
    def __init__(self, make, model, num_doors):
        super().__init__(make, model)  # Call parent constructor
        self.num_doors = num_doors

    def honk(self):
        print("Honk! Honk!")

# Usage
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 4)
my_car.start()  # Inherited from Vehicle
my_car.honk()   # Specific to Car
```

#### 4. **Polymorphism** - Same Interface, Different Behaviors

**Definition**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, with the same method calls producing different results.

**Why it matters**: Enables flexible, extensible code where new types can be added without modifying existing code.

**Real-World Example**: Different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, bank transfer) all implement a "process_payment()" method, but each handles the payment differently.

```python
class PaymentProcessor:
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement process_payment")

class CreditCardProcessor(PaymentProcessor):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        print(f"Processing ${amount} via credit card...")
        # Credit card specific logic
        return f"Credit card payment of ${amount} processed"

class PayPalProcessor(PaymentProcessor):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        print(f"Processing ${amount} via PayPal...")
        # PayPal specific logic
        return f"PayPal payment of ${amount} processed"

# Polymorphic usage
processors = [CreditCardProcessor(), PayPalProcessor()]

for processor in processors:
    result = processor.process_payment(100)  # Same method, different behavior
    print(result)
```

### Understanding Class vs Object

**Class**: A blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects.

- Defines properties (attributes) and methods (functions)
- Doesn't occupy memory until instantiated
- Example: `Car` class defines what all cars have in common

**Object**: A specific instance of a class with actual values.

- Occupies memory and has a unique identity
- Can have different values for the same properties
- Example: `my_red_toyota = Car("Toyota", "Camry", "red")`

### Method Types & Access Levels

**Method Types**:

- **Constructor**: `__init__()` - Initializes new objects
- **Instance Methods**: Work with specific object data
- **Static Methods**: `@staticmethod` - Work without object instances
- **Class Methods**: `@classmethod` - Work with class-level data

**Access Levels**:

- **Public**: Accessible everywhere (default)
- **Private**: `__attribute` - Class-only access
- **Protected**: `_attribute` - Class and subclasses

### Relationship Types

**Association**: "uses-a" relationship (temporary, no ownership)

- Example: Driver uses Car, Customer uses ShoppingCart

**Aggregation**: "has-a" relationship (loose ownership, parts can exist independently)

- Example: Department has Employees (employees can work elsewhere)

**Composition**: "part-of" relationship (tight ownership, parts cannot exist independently)

- Example: Car has Engine (engine is integral to the car)

## 🎯 Practical Application (5 minutes)

### Design Decision Frameworks

#### Inheritance vs Composition

**Choose Inheritance When**:

- Clear IS-A relationship exists
- Shared behavior is needed across subclasses
- The hierarchy is stable and well-understood

**Choose Composition When**:

- HAS-A relationship exists
- You need flexible combinations of behaviors
- The relationships are dynamic

```python
# Inheritance (IS-A relationship)
class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

# Composition (HAS-A relationship)
class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = Engine()  # Car HAS-A Engine
```

#### Abstract Class vs Interface

**Abstract Class**: Use when you want to share implementation and establish IS-A relationships
**Interface**: Use when you want to define contracts without implementation (CAN-DO relationships)

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **God Class**: One class doing too many things → Split responsibilities
2. **Feature Envy**: Class excessively using another class's data → Move behavior to data owner
3. **Long Parameter List**: Too many method parameters → Use parameter objects
4. **Switch Statements**: Type checking instead of polymorphism → Use polymorphic methods

### Practical Exercise

**Scenario**: Design a simple e-commerce system with products, shopping cart, and payment processing.

**Questions to consider**:

1. What classes would you create?
2. Which relationships (inheritance/composition) make sense?
3. How would you apply encapsulation and abstraction?
4. Where would polymorphism be beneficial?
