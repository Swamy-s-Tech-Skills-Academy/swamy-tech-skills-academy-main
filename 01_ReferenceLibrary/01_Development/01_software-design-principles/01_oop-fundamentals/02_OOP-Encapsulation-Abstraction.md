## 📋 Content Sections (27-Minute Structure)

### Quick Review (2 minutes)

**Previous Learning**: Classes as blueprints, objects as instances
**Today's Focus**: Making our classes secure (encapsulation) and simple to use (abstraction)

### Core Concepts (20 minutes)

### **1. Encapsulation: Data Security**

**Definition**: Bundling data and methods together while controlling access to internal details
**Real-World Analogy**: A bank vault protects money (data) and only allows authorized access through specific procedures (methods).

```csharp

```csharpclass D,E,F publicMethod
```csharp
```csharp**Pseudocode Example**:

```text
CLASS BankAccount
```csharp
// 🔒 ENCAPSULATED DATA (Private)
```csharp
```csharp
PRIVATE balance = 0
```csharp
```csharp
PRIVATE accountNumber = ""
```csharp
```csharp
// 🌍 PUBLIC INTERFACE
```csharp
```csharp
PUBLIC CONSTRUCTOR(accountNum, initialBalance)
```csharp
```csharp
    accountNumber = accountNum
```csharp
```csharp
    balance = initialBalance
```csharp
```csharp
END
```csharp
```csharp
PUBLIC METHOD deposit(amount)
```csharp
```csharp
    IF amount > 0 THEN
```csharp
```csharp
        balance = balance + amount
```csharp
```csharp
        RETURN "Deposit successful"
```csharp
```csharp
    END IF
```csharp
```csharp
END
```csharp
```csharp
PUBLIC METHOD getBalance()
```csharp
```csharp
    RETURN balance
```csharp
```csharp
END
```csharp
END CLASS
```csharp#### **2. Access Modifiers**

```text
ACCESS LEVELS:
🌍 PUBLIC     - Accessible everywhere
🏠 PROTECTED  - Class + subclasses only
🔒 PRIVATE    - Same class only
```csharp#### **3. Abstraction: Hiding Complexity**
**Definition**: Showing only essential features while hiding implementation details.
**Real-World Analogy**: Car steering wheel (simple interface) hides complex steering mechanism.

```text
CLASS EmailService
```csharp
// 🎯 SIMPLE PUBLIC INTERFACE
```csharp
```csharp
PUBLIC METHOD sendEmail(recipient, subject, message)
```csharp
```csharp
    CALL validateEmail(recipient)
```csharp
```csharp
    CALL formatMessage(subject, message)
```csharp
```csharp
    CALL transmitEmail()
```csharp
```csharp
    RETURN "Email sent successfully"
```csharp
```csharp
END
```csharp
```csharp
// 🔧 HIDDEN IMPLEMENTATION
```csharp
```csharp
PRIVATE METHOD validateEmail(email)
```csharp
```csharp
    // Complex validation logic
```csharp
```csharp
END
```csharp
```csharp
PRIVATE METHOD formatMessage(subject, message)
```csharp
```csharp
    // HTML formatting logic
```csharp
```csharp
END
```csharp
```csharp
PRIVATE METHOD transmitEmail()
```csharp
```csharp
    // Network protocol handling
```csharp
```csharp
END
```csharp
END CLASS
// 🎯 USER EXPERIENCE: Simple!
emailService = NEW EmailService()
emailService.sendEmail("user@example.com", "Hello", "Welcome!")

### Exercise: Secure Student Grade System

CLASS Student
```csharp
// 🔒 ENCAPSULATED DATA
```csharp
```csharp
PRIVATE studentId = ""
```csharp
```csharp
PRIVATE grades = []
```csharp
```csharp
PRIVATE gpa = 0.0
```csharp
```csharp
// 🌍 PUBLIC INTERFACE
```csharp
```csharp
PUBLIC METHOD addGrade(subject, grade)
```csharp
```csharp
    IF grade >= 0 AND grade <= 100 THEN
```csharp
```csharp
        grades.append({subject: subject, grade: grade})
```csharp
```csharp
        CALL calculateGPA()
```csharp
```csharp
        RETURN "Grade added successfully"
```csharp
```csharp
    END IF
```csharp
```csharp
END
```csharp
```csharp
PUBLIC METHOD getGPA()
```csharp
```csharp
    RETURN gpa
```csharp
```csharp
END
```csharp
```csharp
// 🔧 HIDDEN COMPLEXITY
```csharp
```csharp
PRIVATE METHOD calculateGPA()
```csharp
```csharp
    totalPoints = 0
```csharp
```csharp
    FOR each grade IN grades DO
```csharp
```csharp
        totalPoints = totalPoints + grade.grade
```csharp
```csharp
    END FOR
```csharp
```csharp
    gpa = totalPoints / grades.length
```csharp
```csharp
END
