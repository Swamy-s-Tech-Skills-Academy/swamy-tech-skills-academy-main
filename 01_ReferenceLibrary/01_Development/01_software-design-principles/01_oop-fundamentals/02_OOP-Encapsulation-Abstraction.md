## 📋 Content Sections (27-Minute Structure)
### Quick Review (2 minutes)\n\n\n\n**Previous Learning**: Classes as blueprints, objects as instances
**Today's Focus**: Making our classes secure (encapsulation) and simple to use (abstraction)
### Core Concepts (20 minutes)\n\n
### **1. Encapsulation: Data Security**\n\n\n\n**Definition**: Bundling data and methods together while controlling access to internal details
**Real-World Analogy**: A bank vault protects money (data) and only allows authorized access through specific procedures (methods).

```text
CLASS BankAccount
```csharp\n// 🔒 ENCAPSULATED DATA (Private)\n```csharp\n```csharp\nPRIVATE balance = 0\n```csharp\n```csharp\nPRIVATE accountNumber = ""\n```csharp\n```csharp\n// 🌍 PUBLIC INTERFACE\n```csharp\n```csharp\nPUBLIC CONSTRUCTOR(accountNum, initialBalance)\n```csharp\n```csharp\n    accountNumber = accountNum\n```csharp\n```csharp\n    balance = initialBalance\n```csharp\n```csharp\nEND\n```csharp\n```csharp\nPUBLIC METHOD deposit(amount)\n```csharp\n```csharp\n    IF amount > 0 THEN\n```csharp\n```csharp\n        balance = balance + amount\n```csharp\n```csharp\n        RETURN "Deposit successful"\n```csharp\n```csharp\n    END IF\n```csharp\n```csharp\nEND\n```csharp\n```csharp\nPUBLIC METHOD getBalance()\n```csharp\n```csharp\n    RETURN balance\n```csharp\n```csharp\nEND\n```csharp\nEND CLASS
```csharp#### **2. Access Modifiers**
```text
ACCESS LEVELS:
🌍 PUBLIC     - Accessible everywhere
🏠 PROTECTED  - Class + subclasses only
🔒 PRIVATE    - Same class only
```csharp#### **3. Abstraction: Hiding Complexity**
**Definition**: Showing only essential features while hiding implementation details.
**Real-World Analogy**: Car steering wheel (simple interface) hides complex steering mechanism.

CLASS EmailService
```csharp\n// 🎯 SIMPLE PUBLIC INTERFACE\n```csharp\n```csharp\nPUBLIC METHOD sendEmail(recipient, subject, message)\n```csharp\n```csharp\n    CALL validateEmail(recipient)\n```csharp\n```csharp\n    CALL formatMessage(subject, message)\n```csharp\n```csharp\n    CALL transmitEmail()\n```csharp\n```csharp\n    RETURN "Email sent successfully"\n```csharp\n```csharp\nEND\n```csharp\n```csharp\n// 🔧 HIDDEN IMPLEMENTATION\n```csharp\n```csharp\nPRIVATE METHOD validateEmail(email)\n```csharp\n```csharp\n    // Complex validation logic\n```csharp\n```csharp\nEND\n```csharp\n```csharp\nPRIVATE METHOD formatMessage(subject, message)\n```csharp\n```csharp\n    // HTML formatting logic\n```csharp\n```csharp\nEND\n```csharp\n```csharp\nPRIVATE METHOD transmitEmail()\n```csharp\n```csharp\n    // Network protocol handling\n```csharp\n```csharp\nEND\n```csharp\nEND CLASS
