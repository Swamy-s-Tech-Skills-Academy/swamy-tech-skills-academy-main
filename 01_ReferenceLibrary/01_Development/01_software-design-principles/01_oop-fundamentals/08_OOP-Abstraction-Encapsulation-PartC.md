By the end of this 27-minute session, you will:

- Understand the fundamental differences between abstraction and encapsulation
- Apply both principles effectively in object-oriented design
- Recognize when and how to use each principle for better code organization

**Abstraction** and **Encapsulation** are two fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and while they are closely related, they serve different purposes. Here's a comparison:

### **8. Dependency**

- **Definition**: When one class relies on another to perform its operations

- **Key Points**:

  - Promotes loose coupling with dependency injection.

### **Example**

```csharp
class Service {
```csharp
public void PerformOperation() {
```csharp
```csharp
    Console.WriteLine("Operation performed.");
```csharp
    }
}
class Client {
```csharp
private Service service;
```csharp
```csharp
public Client(Service service) {
```csharp
```csharp
    this.service = service;
```csharp
    }
```csharp
public void Start() {
```csharp
```csharp
    service.PerformOperation();
```csharp
    }
}

```csharp---

### **9. Realization**





- **Definition**: A class implements the behavior defined by an interface

- **Purpose**: Provides a contract that a class must adhere to.

### **Example**





```csharp

interface IShape {
```csharp
double GetArea();
```csharp
}
class Circle : IShape {
```csharp
private double radius;
```csharp
```csharp
public Circle(double radius) {
```csharp
```csharp
    this.radius = radius;
```csharp
    }
```csharp
public double GetArea() {
```csharp
```csharp
    return Math.PI * radius * radius;
```csharp
    }
}

```csharp

### **OOP Principles:**





| Principle         | Definition                                                | C# Implementation                  | Example                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Encapsulation** | Hiding internal state and exposing controlled access.     | Access Modifiers, Properties       | `private`, `public`, `protected`   |
| **Abstraction**   | Hiding implementation details and exposing functionality. | Abstract Classes, Interfaces       | `abstract`, `interface`            |
| **Inheritance**   | Acquiring properties and behavior of another class.       | Derived Classes                    | `class Dog : Animal`               |
| **Polymorphism**  | Using a single interface to represent different types.    | Method Overriding, Virtual Methods | `virtual`, `override`, `interface` |

### UML Class Diagram for OOP in C





### **Description**





- A simple UML class diagram can represent relationships such as aggregation, composition, inheritance, and realization in the context of OOP in C#
  - Example: A `Vehicle` class (generalization) has subclasses like `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and an `Engine` class (composition) is part of the `Car`.

### **Link to Learn UML**

  - [PlantUML Online Tool](https://plantuml.com/class-diagram)

If you need further UML diagrams or detailed code examples for each principle, let me know!

Here's the **PlantUML** text for a class diagram that illustrates the **OOP principles in C#**. It includes relationships like inheritance, composition, and realization:
```plantuml
@startuml
title OOP in C#
class Vehicle {
  - string Make
  - string Model
```csharp
+ void Start()
```csharp
}
class Car {
  - int Doors
}
class Motorcycle {
  - bool HasSidecar
}
Vehicle <|-- Car
Vehicle <|-- Motorcycle
class Engine {
  - string Type
}
Car *-- Engine : Composition
interface IShape {
```csharp
+ double GetArea()
```csharp
}
class Circle {
  - double Radius
```csharp
+ double GetArea()
```csharp
}
IShape <|.. Circle : Realization
@enduml
```

### **Explanation of the Diagram**

1. **Inheritance**:

- `Vehicle` is the parent class, and `Car` and `Motorcycle` are child classes.
- Represented by the `<|--` notation.

1. **Composition**:

   - `Car` contains an `Engine`, indicating a "has-a (strong)" relationship.

- Represented by the `*--` notation.

1. **Realization**:

   - `Circle` implements the `IShape` interface.

- Represented by the `<|..` notation.

1. **Class Members**:

   - Fields and methods are specified within classes.

- `+` denotes public, `-` denotes private.
