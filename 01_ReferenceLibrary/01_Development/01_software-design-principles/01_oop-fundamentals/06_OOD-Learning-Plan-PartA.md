## **Week 1: Core OOD Concepts**
### **Goals**\n\n\n\n- Understand the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Explore and implement **interfaces**, **abstraction**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism** in C#.\n\n### **Topics to Cover**\n\n\n\n1. **Introduction to OOP and OOD**
1. **Encapsulation** and **data hiding**
2. **Abstraction**: Abstract classes vs. Interfaces
3. **Interfaces in C#**: Declaring, implementing, and extending interfaces
4. **Polymorphism and Inheritance**: Overriding and virtual methods\n\n### **Exercises**\n\n\n\n1. Create classes for a simple inventory management system, with interfaces for **IProduct** (e.g., `AddProduct()`, `RemoveProduct()`) and **ICategory**.
5. Practice creating and implementing an interface for a **PaymentSystem** (e.g., `IPaymentMethod`) with multiple payment methods (`CreditCard`, `PayPal`, etc.).
6. Implement a **Shape** hierarchy, using an `IShape` interface for `Draw()` and `CalculateArea()` methods, and classes like `Circle`, `Rectangle`, etc.\n\n---
## **Week 2: SOLID Principles and Design Patterns**
### **Goals**\n\n\n\n- Learn and apply the **SOLID principles** for better OOD
- Get familiar with design patterns that leverage interfaces and abstraction.\n\n### **Topics to Cover**\n\n\n\n1. **SOLID Principles**:
   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
7. **Key Design Patterns**:\n\n   - **Factory Method** and **Abstract Factory**
   - **Strategy Pattern**
   - **Decorator Pattern**
### **Exercises**\n\n\n\n1. **Refactor Code**: Take any simple system (e.g., inventory or user management) and apply SOLID principles to it
8. **Implement Patterns**:\n\n   - **Strategy Pattern**: Implement a strategy for `IPaymentMethod` to handle multiple payment options without altering the primary payment processing class.
   - **Decorator Pattern**: Create decorators to add additional responsibilities to a `Notification` class, e.g., `SMSNotification`, `EmailNotification`.
9. **ISP Exercise**: Define a large interface, break it down into smaller, more specific interfaces, and refactor classes to implement only what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s necessary.\n\n---
## **Week 3: Advanced OOD with Real-World Problem-Solving**
### **Goals**\n\n\n\n- Practice designing systems with a focus on scalability and maintainability
- Learn to break down a problem and identify classes, relationships, and interfaces.\n\n### **Topics to Cover**\n\n\n\n1. **Abstraction and Modularity**: Identifying abstractions in problem statements.
10. **System Design Principles**: Cohesion, coupling, and modularity.
11. **Common Object-Oriented Design Problems**:\n\n   - Design a Parking Lot system.
   - Design an ATM machine.
   - Design a File System structure.
### **Exercises**\n\n\n\n1. **Design a Library System**:
   - Identify key entities (`Book`, `User`, `Library`) and behaviors.
   - Create interfaces for `ILibraryActions` (e.g., `CheckOutBook()`, `ReturnBook()`).
12. **Design a Notification System**:\n\n   - Design interfaces like `INotificationService` for different types of notifications (`Email`, `SMS`, `Push`).
   - Implement classes to use a **Factory pattern** for notification creation.
13. **OOD Case Study**: Pick a problem from a past interview question bank and work through the system design.\n\n---
## **Week 4: Mock Interviews and Review**
### **Goals**\n\n\n\n- Review key concepts and practice live coding
- Focus on real-time problem-solving and communicating design decisions effectively.\n\n### **Topics to Cover**\n\n\n\n1. **Mock Interview Questions**:
   - Practice with mock OOD interview questions.
   - Get comfortable explaining your design decisions clearly and concisely.
14. **Review of SOLID, Design Patterns, and Key Concepts**.
15. **Common Pitfalls and Best Practices in OOD Interviews**:\n\n   - Avoid over-engineering.
   - Focus on flexibility, reusability, and clarity.
### **Exercises**\n\n\n\n1. **Mock Interview Questions**:
   - **Design a Movie Booking System**.
   - **Design a Hotel Reservation System**.
16. **Peer Review and Feedback**:\n\n   - Work with peers or mentors to review each other√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s code.
   - Focus on code quality, adherence to SOLID, and use of patterns.
17. **Final Review**: Go back over your previous projects, looking for areas to refactor or improve.\n\n---
