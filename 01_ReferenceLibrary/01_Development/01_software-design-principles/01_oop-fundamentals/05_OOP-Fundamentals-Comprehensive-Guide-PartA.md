## 🚀 Quick Overview (5 minutes)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around **objects** rather than actions and data rather than logic. Since its introduction in the 1960s with Simula, OOP has become the foundation of modern software development.

### Why OOP Matters for Lead Architects

As a Lead Architect, understanding OOP isn't just about writing code—it's about designing systems that can evolve, scale, and maintain quality at enterprise levels. The four pillars of OOP provide the architectural foundation for building maintainable, extensible software systems.

## 🏗️ Core Concepts (15 minutes)

### The Four Pillars of OOP

OOP is built on four fundamental principles that work together to create robust, maintainable code:

#### 1. **Encapsulation** - Data Protection & Modularity

**Definition**: Encapsulation bundles data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), while controlling access to that data through well-defined interfaces.

**Why it matters**: Prevents external code from directly manipulating an object's internal state, reducing bugs and making code more maintainable.

**Real-World Example**: A bank account class encapsulates the balance and provides controlled access through deposit() and withdraw() methods.

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):
        self.__balance = initial_balance  # Private attribute

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount
            return True
        return False

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
            return True
        return False

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

# Usage - external code can't directly modify balance

account = BankAccount(1000)
account.deposit(500)  # ✅ Controlled access

# account.__balance = -1000  # ❌ Not allowed (would break encapsulation)

```

#### 2. **Abstraction** - Hiding Complexity

**Definition**: Abstraction focuses on showing only essential features while hiding implementation details.

**Why it matters**: Simplifies complex systems by providing clean interfaces that users can interact with without understanding internal complexity.

**Real-World Example**: When you drive a car, you use the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift (abstraction) without needing to understand the internal combustion engine or transmission mechanics.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class DatabaseConnection(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def connect(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def execute_query(self, query):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def close(self):
        pass

# Users work with this clean interface

# Implementation details (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) are hidden

```

#### 3. **Inheritance** - Code Reuse & Relationships

**Definition**: Inheritance allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent/superclass), establishing IS-A relationships.

**Why it matters**: Promotes code reuse, establishes clear hierarchies, and enables polymorphism.

**Real-World Example**: A Car IS-A Vehicle. All vehicles have common properties (speed, direction) and behaviors (start, stop), but cars have additional specific features.

```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.speed = 0

    def start(self):
        print(f"{self.make} {self.model} starting...")

    def stop(self):
        self.speed = 0
        print(f"{self.make} {self.model} stopped.")

class Car(Vehicle):  # Car IS-A Vehicle

    def __init__(self, make, model, num_doors):
        super().__init__(make, model)  # Call parent constructor

        self.num_doors = num_doors

    def honk(self):
        print("Honk! Honk!")

# Usage

my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 4)
my_car.start()  # Inherited from Vehicle

my_car.honk()   # Specific to Car

```

#### 4. **Polymorphism** - Same Interface, Different Behaviors

**Definition**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, with the same method calls producing different results.

**Why it matters**: Enables flexible, extensible code where new types can be added without modifying existing code.

**Real-World Example**: Different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, bank transfer) all implement a "process_payment()" method, but each handles the payment differently.

```python
class PaymentProcessor:
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement process_payment")

class CreditCardProcessor(PaymentProcessor):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        print(f"Processing ${amount} via credit card...")
        # Credit card specific logic

        return f"Credit card payment of ${amount} processed"

class PayPalProcessor(PaymentProcessor):
