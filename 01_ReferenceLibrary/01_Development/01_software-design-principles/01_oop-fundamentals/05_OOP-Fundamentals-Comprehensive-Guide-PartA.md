## 🚀 Quick Overview (5 minutes)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around **objects** rather than actions and data rather than logic. Since its introduction in the 1960s with Simula, OOP has become the foundation of modern software development

### Why OOP Matters for Lead Architects

##

As a Lead Architect, understanding OOP isn't just about writing code—it's about designing systems that can evolve, scale, and maintain quality at enterprise levels. The four pillars of OOP provide the architectural foundation for building maintainable, extensible software systems

## 🏗️ Core Concepts (15 minutes)

### The Four Pillars of OOP

OOP is built on four fundamental principles that work together to create robust, maintainable code:

### 1. **Encapsulation** - Data Protection & Modularity

**Definition**: Encapsulation bundles data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), while controlling access to that data through well-defined interfaces
**Why it matters**: Prevents external code from directly manipulating an object's internal state, reducing bugs and making code more maintainable.
**Real-World Example**: A bank account class encapsulates the balance and provides controlled access through deposit() and withdraw() methods.

```python
class BankAccount:
```csharp
def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):
```csharp
```csharp
    self.__balance = initial_balance  # Private attribute
```csharp
```csharp
def deposit(self, amount):
```csharp
```csharp
    if amount > 0:
```csharp
```csharp
        self.__balance += amount
```csharp
```csharp
        return True
```csharp
```csharp
    return False
```csharp
```csharp
def withdraw(self, amount):
```csharp
```csharp
    if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:
```csharp
```csharp
        self.__balance -= amount
```csharp
```csharp
        return True
```csharp
```csharp
    return False
```csharp
```csharp
def get_balance(self):
```csharp
```csharp
    return self.__balance
```csharp
## Usage - external code can't directly modify balance

account = BankAccount(1000)
account.deposit(500)  # ✅ Controlled access

## account.__balance = -1000  # ❌ Not allowed (would break encapsulation)

```csharp#### 2. **Abstraction** - Hiding Complexity

**Definition**: Abstraction focuses on showing only essential features while hiding implementation details.
**Why it matters**: Simplifies complex systems by providing clean interfaces that users can interact with without understanding internal complexity.
**Real-World Example**: When you drive a car, you use the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift (abstraction) without needing to understand the internal combustion engine or transmission mechanics.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class DatabaseConnection(ABC):
```csharp
@abstractmethod
```csharp
```csharp
def connect(self):
```csharp
```csharp
    pass
```csharp
```csharp
@abstractmethod
```csharp
```csharp
def execute_query(self, query):
```csharp
```csharp
    pass
```csharp
```csharp
@abstractmethod
```csharp
```csharp
def close(self):
```csharp
```csharp
    pass
```csharp
## Users work with this clean interface

## Implementation details (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) are hidden

```csharp#### 3. **Inheritance** - Code Reuse & Relationships

**Definition**: Inheritance allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent/superclass), establishing IS-A relationships.
**Why it matters**: Promotes code reuse, establishes clear hierarchies, and enables polymorphism.
**Real-World Example**: A Car IS-A Vehicle. All vehicles have common properties (speed, direction) and behaviors (start, stop), but cars have additional specific features.

```python
class Vehicle:
```csharp
def __init__(self, make, model):
```csharp
```csharp
    self.make = make
```csharp
```csharp
    self.model = model
```csharp
```csharp
    self.speed = 0
```csharp
```csharp
def start(self):
```csharp
```csharp
    print(f"{self.make} {self.model} starting...")
```csharp
```csharp
def stop(self):
```csharp
```csharp
    self.speed = 0
```csharp
```csharp
    print(f"{self.make} {self.model} stopped.")
```csharp
class Car(Vehicle):  # Car IS-A Vehicle
```csharp
def __init__(self, make, model, num_doors):
```csharp
```csharp
    super().__init__(make, model)  # Call parent constructor
```csharp
```csharp
    self.num_doors = num_doors
```csharp
```csharp
def honk(self):
```csharp
```csharp
    print("Honk! Honk!")
```csharp
## Usage

my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 4)
my_car.start()  # Inherited from Vehicle
my_car.honk()   # Specific to Car
```csharp#### 4. **Polymorphism** - Same Interface, Different Behaviors
**Definition**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, with the same method calls producing different results.
**Why it matters**: Enables flexible, extensible code where new types can be added without modifying existing code.
**Real-World Example**: Different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, bank transfer) all implement a "process_payment()" method, but each handles the payment differently.

```python
class PaymentProcessor:
```csharp
def process_payment(self, amount):
```csharp
```csharp
    raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement process_payment")
```csharp
class CreditCardProcessor(PaymentProcessor):
```csharp
def process_payment(self, amount):
```csharp
```csharp
    print(f"Processing ${amount} via credit card...")
```csharp
```csharp
    # Credit card specific logic
```csharp
```csharp
    return f"Credit card payment of ${amount} processed"
```csharp
class PayPalProcessor(PaymentProcessor):
