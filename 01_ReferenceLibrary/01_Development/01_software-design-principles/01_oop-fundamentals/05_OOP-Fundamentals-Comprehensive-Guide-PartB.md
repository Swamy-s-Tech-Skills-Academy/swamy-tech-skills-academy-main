### Understanding Class vs Object

\n\n\n\n**Class**: A blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects
  - Defines properties (attributes) and methods (functions)
  - Doesn't occupy memory until instantiated
  - Example: `Car` class defines what all cars have in common\n\n**Object**: A specific instance of a class with actual values.
  - Occupies memory and has a unique identity
  - Can have different values for the same properties
  - Example: `my_red_toyota = Car("Toyota", "Camry", "red")`\n\n### Method Types & Access Levels

\n\n\n\n**Method Types**:
  - **Constructor**: `__init__()` - Initializes new objects
  - **Instance Methods**: Work with specific object data
  - **Static Methods**: `@staticmethod` - Work without object instances
  - **Class Methods**: `@classmethod` - Work with class-level data\n\n**Access Levels**:
  - **Public**: Accessible everywhere (default)
  - **Private**: `__attribute` - Class-only access
  - **Protected**: `_attribute` - Class and subclasses\n\n### Relationship Types

\n\n\n\n**Association**: "uses-a" relationship (temporary, no ownership)
  - Example: Driver uses Car, Customer uses ShoppingCart\n\n**Aggregation**: "has-a" relationship (loose ownership, parts can exist independently)
  - Example: Department has Employees (employees can work elsewhere)\n\n**Composition**: "part-of" relationship (tight ownership, parts cannot exist independently)
##   - Example: Car has Engine (engine is integral to the car)

### Design Decision Frameworks

### Inheritance vs Composition

\n\n\n\n**Choose Inheritance When**:
  - Clear IS-A relationship exists
  - Shared behavior is needed across subclasses
  - The hierarchy is stable and well-understood\n\n**Choose Composition When**:
  - HAS-A relationship exists
  - You need flexible combinations of behaviors
  - The relationships are dynamic\n\n```python\n\n## Inheritance (IS-A relationship)\n\nclass Dog(Animal):

```csharp\ndef make_sound(self):\n```csharp\n```csharp\n    return "Woof!"\n```csharp\n## Composition (HAS-A relationship)\n\nclass Car:
```csharp\ndef __init__(self):\n```csharp\n```csharp    self.engine = Engine()  # Car HAS-A Engine
```csharp
```csharp\n### Abstract Class vs Interface
\n\n\n\n**Abstract Class**: Use when you want to share implementation and establish IS-A relationships
**Interface**: Use when you want to define contracts without implementation (CAN-DO relationships)

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

\n\n\n\n1. **God Class**: One class doing too many things Ã¢â€ â€™ Split responsibilities

1. **Feature Envy**: Class excessively using another class's data Ã¢â€ â€™ Move behavior to data owner
1. **Long Parameter List**: Too many method parameters Ã¢â€ â€™ Use parameter objects
1. **Switch Statements**: Type checking instead of polymorphism Ã¢â€ â€™ Use polymorphic methods\n\n### Practical Exercise

\n\n\n\n**Scenario**: Design a simple e-commerce system with products, shopping cart, and payment processing.
**Questions to consider**:

1. What classes would you create?
1. Which relationships (inheritance/composition) make sense?
1. How would you apply encapsulation and abstraction?
1. Where would polymorphism be beneficial?\n\n---\n\n## Ã°Å¸Å½Â¯ Key Takeaways & Next Steps (2 minutes)
### Key Takeaways

\n\n\n\n- **Encapsulation** protects data integrity and enables modularity
  - **Abstraction** simplifies complex systems through clean interfaces
  - **Inheritance** enables code reuse through IS-A relationships
  - **Polymorphism** provides flexibility through same-interface, different-behavior
  - Choose composition over inheritance when relationships are flexible
  - Design for extension, not modification\n\n### Next Steps

\n\n\n\n1. **Practice**: Implement the e-commerce system exercise above

1. **Explore**: [06_SOLID-Principles](../02_SOLID-Principles/) for advanced design guidelines
1. **Apply**: Refactor existing code to use OOP principles
1. **Study**: Real-world examples in popular frameworks\n\n### Related Topics
