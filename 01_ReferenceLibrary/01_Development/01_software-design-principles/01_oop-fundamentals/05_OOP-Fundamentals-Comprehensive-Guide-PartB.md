## Part B of 2

Previous: [05_OOP-Fundamentals-Comprehensive-Guide-PartA.md](05_OOP-Fundamentals-Comprehensive-Guide-PartA.md)

```csharp
def process_payment(self, amount):
```csharp
```csharp
    print(f"Processing ${amount} via PayPal...")
```csharp
```csharp
    # PayPal specific logic
```csharp
```csharp
    return f"PayPal payment of ${amount} processed"
```csharp
## Polymorphic Usage

processors = [CreditCardProcessor(), PayPalProcessor()]
for processor in processors:
```csharp
result = processor.process_payment(100)  # Same method, different behavior
```csharp
```csharpprint(result)

```csharp
```python

### Understanding Class vs Object





**Class**: A blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects
  - Defines properties (attributes) and methods (functions)
  - Doesn't occupy memory until instantiated
  - Example: `Car` class defines what all cars have in common

**Object**: A specific instance of a class with actual values.
  - Occupies memory and has a unique identity
  - Can have different values for the same properties
  - Example: `my_red_toyota = Car("Toyota", "Camry", "red")`

### Method Types & Access Levels





**Method Types**:
  - **Constructor**: `__init__()` - Initializes new objects
  - **Instance Methods**: Work with specific object data
  - **Static Methods**: `@staticmethod` - Work without object instances
  - **Class Methods**: `@classmethod` - Work with class-level data

**Access Levels**:
  - **Public**: Accessible everywhere (default)
  - **Private**: `__attribute` - Class-only access
  - **Protected**: `_attribute` - Class and subclasses

### Relationship Types





**Association**: "uses-a" relationship (temporary, no ownership)
  - Example: Driver uses Car, Customer uses ShoppingCart

**Aggregation**: "has-a" relationship (loose ownership, parts can exist independently)
  - Example: Department has Employees (employees can work elsewhere)

**Composition**: "part-of" relationship (tight ownership, parts cannot exist independently)
##   - Example: Car has Engine (engine is integral to the car)
## 🎯 Practical Application (5 minutes)
### Design Decision Frameworks





### Inheritance vs Composition





**Choose Inheritance When**:
  - Clear IS-A relationship exists
  - Shared behavior is needed across subclasses
  - The hierarchy is stable and well-understood

**Choose Composition When**:
  - HAS-A relationship exists
  - You need flexible combinations of behaviors
  - The relationships are dynamic

```python

## Inheritance (IS-A relationship)

class Dog(Animal):

```csharp
def make_sound(self):
```csharp
```csharp
    return "Woof!"
```csharp
## Composition (HAS-A relationship)

class Car:
```csharp
def __init__(self):
```csharp
```csharp    self.engine = Engine()  # Car HAS-A Engine
```csharp
```csharp
### Abstract Class vs Interface




**Abstract Class**: Use when you want to share implementation and establish IS-A relationships
**Interface**: Use when you want to define contracts without implementation (CAN-DO relationships)

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid





1. **God Class**: One class doing too many things → Split responsibilities

1. **Feature Envy**: Class excessively using another class's data → Move behavior to data owner
1. **Long Parameter List**: Too many method parameters → Use parameter objects
1. **Switch Statements**: Type checking instead of polymorphism → Use polymorphic methods

### Practical Exercise





**Scenario**: Design a simple e-commerce system with products, shopping cart, and payment processing.
**Questions to consider**:

1. What classes would you create?
1. Which relationships (inheritance/composition) make sense?
1. How would you apply encapsulation and abstraction?
1. Where would polymorphism be beneficial?

## 🎯 Key Takeaways & Next Steps (2 minutes)
### Key Takeaways





- **Encapsulation** protects data integrity and enables modularity
  - **Abstraction** simplifies complex systems through clean interfaces
  - **Inheritance** enables code reuse through IS-A relationships
  - **Polymorphism** provides flexibility through same-interface, different-behavior
  - Choose composition over inheritance when relationships are flexible
  - Design for extension, not modification

### Next Steps





1. **Practice**: Implement the e-commerce system exercise above

1. **Explore**: [06_SOLID-Principles](../02_SOLID-Principles/) for advanced design guidelines
1. **Apply**: Refactor existing code to use OOP principles
1. **Study**: Real-world examples in popular frameworks
