**Learning Level**: Beginner â†’ Intermediate
**Prerequisites**: Basic programming knowledge (variables, functions, loops)
**Estimated Time**: 27 minutes (focused learning session)
**Next Steps**: [06_SOLID-Principles](../02_SOLID-Principles/) for advanced design patterns

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this 27-minute session, you will:

- Understand the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming and their practical applications
- Master class design, inheritance relationships, and polymorphism patterns
- Apply encapsulation and abstraction principles in real-world scenarios
- Make informed decisions between inheritance vs composition and abstract classes vs interfaces
- Identify and avoid common OOP anti-patterns in your code

    def process_payment(self, amount):
        print(f"Processing ${amount} via PayPal...")
        # PayPal specific logic
        return f"PayPal payment of ${amount} processed"

# Polymorphic usage
processors = [CreditCardProcessor(), PayPalProcessor()]

for processor in processors:
    result = processor.process_payment(100)  # Same method, different behavior
    print(result)
```

### Understanding Class vs Object

**Class**: A blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects.

- Defines properties (attributes) and methods (functions)
- Doesn't occupy memory until instantiated
- Example: `Car` class defines what all cars have in common

**Object**: A specific instance of a class with actual values.

- Occupies memory and has a unique identity
- Can have different values for the same properties
- Example: `my_red_toyota = Car("Toyota", "Camry", "red")`

### Method Types & Access Levels

**Method Types**:

- **Constructor**: `__init__()` - Initializes new objects
- **Instance Methods**: Work with specific object data
- **Static Methods**: `@staticmethod` - Work without object instances
- **Class Methods**: `@classmethod` - Work with class-level data

**Access Levels**:

- **Public**: Accessible everywhere (default)
- **Private**: `__attribute` - Class-only access
- **Protected**: `_attribute` - Class and subclasses

### Relationship Types

**Association**: "uses-a" relationship (temporary, no ownership)

- Example: Driver uses Car, Customer uses ShoppingCart

**Aggregation**: "has-a" relationship (loose ownership, parts can exist independently)

- Example: Department has Employees (employees can work elsewhere)

**Composition**: "part-of" relationship (tight ownership, parts cannot exist independently)

- Example: Car has Engine (engine is integral to the car)

## ðŸŽ¯ Practical Application (5 minutes)

### Design Decision Frameworks

#### Inheritance vs Composition

**Choose Inheritance When**:

- Clear IS-A relationship exists
- Shared behavior is needed across subclasses
- The hierarchy is stable and well-understood

**Choose Composition When**:

- HAS-A relationship exists
- You need flexible combinations of behaviors
- The relationships are dynamic

```python
# Inheritance (IS-A relationship)
class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

# Composition (HAS-A relationship)
class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = Engine()  # Car HAS-A Engine
```

#### Abstract Class vs Interface

**Abstract Class**: Use when you want to share implementation and establish IS-A relationships
**Interface**: Use when you want to define contracts without implementation (CAN-DO relationships)

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **God Class**: One class doing too many things â†’ Split responsibilities
2. **Feature Envy**: Class excessively using another class's data â†’ Move behavior to data owner
3. **Long Parameter List**: Too many method parameters â†’ Use parameter objects
4. **Switch Statements**: Type checking instead of polymorphism â†’ Use polymorphic methods

### Practical Exercise

**Scenario**: Design a simple e-commerce system with products, shopping cart, and payment processing.

**Questions to consider**:

1. What classes would you create?
2. Which relationships (inheritance/composition) make sense?
3. How would you apply encapsulation and abstraction?
4. Where would polymorphism be beneficial?

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways & Next Steps (2 minutes)

### Key Takeaways

- **Encapsulation** protects data integrity and enables modularity
- **Abstraction** simplifies complex systems through clean interfaces
- **Inheritance** enables code reuse through IS-A relationships
- **Polymorphism** provides flexibility through same-interface, different-behavior
- Choose composition over inheritance when relationships are flexible
- Design for extension, not modification

### Next Steps

1. **Practice**: Implement the e-commerce system exercise above
2. **Explore**: [06_SOLID-Principles](../02_SOLID-Principles/) for advanced design guidelines
3. **Apply**: Refactor existing code to use OOP principles
4. **Study**: Real-world examples in popular frameworks
