## 📋 Content Sections (27-Minute Structure)

### Quick Overview (5 minutes)

**Microservices Architecture**: An approach to developing applications as a suite of small, autonomous services that communicate over well-defined APIs.

Microservices Decision Matrix
├── Team Size: 5-10+ developers per service
├── Complexity: High business domain complexity
├── Scale Requirements: Independent scaling needs
├── Technology Diversity: Different tech stacks needed
└── Deployment Frequency: Independent deployment required
```

### Core Concepts (12 minutes)

#### Definition and Core Principles

Microservices architecture is an approach to developing applications as a suite of small, autonomous services that communicate over well-defined APIs. Each service is:

- **Independently deployable**
- **Organized around business capabilities**
- **Owned by a small team**
- **Decentralized in governance and data management**

#### When to Choose Microservices

**✅ Good Fit Scenarios:**

- Large, complex applications with multiple business domains
- Teams that can work independently on different services
- Applications requiring different scaling patterns per component
- Organizations adopting DevOps practices
- Systems needing frequent, independent deployments

**❌ Poor Fit Scenarios:**

- Small applications with simple business logic
- Teams without microservices experience
- Applications with tight coupling requirements
- Systems with limited DevOps infrastructure
- Projects with strict timeline constraints

### Service Decomposition Strategies (10 minutes)

#### 1. Domain-Driven Decomposition

**Bounded Context Analysis**: Identify business domains and their boundaries

```text
E-commerce Domain Decomposition
├── Order Management Service
│   ├── Order creation and validation
│   ├── Payment processing coordination
│   └── Order status tracking
├── Inventory Service
│   ├── Stock level management
│   ├── Product catalog maintenance
│   └── Supplier integration
├── Shipping Service
│   ├── Shipping cost calculation
│   ├── Carrier integration
│   └── Delivery tracking
└── Customer Service
    ├── Customer profile management
    ├── Loyalty program handling
    └── Customer communication
```

**Decomposition Guidelines:**

- Each service should have a single, well-defined responsibility
- Services should be loosely coupled but highly cohesive
- Business capabilities should drive service boundaries
- Team size should match service complexity

#### 2. Data Decomposition Patterns

**Database per Service Pattern:**

- Each microservice owns its data
- Private database schema per service
- Data access through service APIs only

```text
Database Ownership Pattern
├── Order Service → order_db (MySQL)
│   ├── orders table
│   ├── order_items table
│   └── payment_details table
├── Customer Service → customer_db (PostgreSQL)
│   ├── customers table
│   ├── addresses table
│   └── preferences table
└── Product Service → product_db (MongoDB)
    ├── products collection
    ├── categories collection
    └── inventory collection
```

**Data Consistency Approaches:**

- **Eventual Consistency**: Accept temporary inconsistencies
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transaction coordination
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models
- **Event Sourcing**: Store state changes as events

## ✅ Key Takeaways (2 minutes)

### **Essential Understanding**

1. **Microservices require careful planning** - not a default choice for all applications
2. **Domain-driven design is crucial** for proper service boundaries
3. **Data ownership patterns** prevent tight coupling between services
4. **Team structure influences** service decomposition decisions

### **What's Next**

**Part B** will cover:

- Synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns
- API design principles for microservices
- Message queuing and event-driven communication
