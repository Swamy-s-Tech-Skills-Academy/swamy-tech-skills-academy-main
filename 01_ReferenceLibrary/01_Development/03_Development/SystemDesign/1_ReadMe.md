# System Design Track (Legacy Placeholder)

This legacy placeholder satisfies historical links pointing to `SystemDesign/1_ReadMe.md`.

Status: Content not yet migrated. A modern, progressive system design learning path will replace this stub.

Planned outline (draft):

1. Foundations: scalability, reliability, latency vs throughput
2. Core Building Blocks: load balancers, caches, queues, databases
3. Data Strategies: sharding, replication, consistency models
4. Design Method: clarify requirements → rough capacity → high-level architecture → component deep dive → bottleneck analysis → evolution
5. Deep Dives: messaging systems, real-time delivery, search indexing, feed generation
6. Non-Functional Concerns: observability, cost efficiency, security, compliance
7. Trade-off Patterns: CQRS, Event Sourcing, Backpressure, Circuit Breakers

Next Action: Replace this with a numbered structured path under `03_ReferenceLibrary` once modernization occurs. Until then, links should not be removed to preserve historical navigation integrity.

"Coming soon".
