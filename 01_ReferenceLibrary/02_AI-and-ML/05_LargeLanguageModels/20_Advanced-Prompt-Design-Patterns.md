## 🏗️ The Architecture of Effective Prompts

### **Why Structure Matters**

Just as software architecture determines system quality, prompt architecture determines AI output quality. Poor prompt structure leads to:

- **Inconsistent outputs** that vary unpredictably
- **Missed requirements** and incomplete responses  
- **Wasted tokens** and unnecessary API costs
- **Debugging nightmares** when results don't meet expectations

```

### **Role Specialization Patterns**

```python
class RoleBasedPromptBuilder:
    """Build specialized prompts for different professional contexts."""
    
    ROLE_TEMPLATES = {
        "security_auditor": {
            "context": "You are a cybersecurity specialist conducting code reviews",
            "focus": ["vulnerability detection", "compliance checking", "risk assessment"],
            "output_style": "structured security report with severity ratings"
        },
        
        "data_architect": {
            "context": "You are a senior data architect designing enterprise systems", 
            "focus": ["scalability", "performance", "data governance", "integration patterns"],
            "output_style": "technical specification with architectural diagrams"
        },
        
        "performance_engineer": {
            "context": "You are a performance optimization specialist",
            "focus": ["bottleneck identification", "resource optimization", "scalability analysis"],
            "output_style": "performance analysis with metrics and recommendations"
        }
    }
    
    def build_prompt(self, role: str, task: str, constraints: list = None) -> str:
        """Generate role-specific prompts."""
        template = self.ROLE_TEMPLATES.get(role)
        if not template:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown role: {role}")
        
        prompt = f"""
ROLE: {template['context']}

EXPERTISE FOCUS: {', '.join(template['focus'])}

TASK: {task}

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS: {template['output_style']}
"""
        
        if constraints:
            prompt += f"\nCONSTRAINTS:\n" + "\n".join(f"- {c}" for c in constraints)
            
        return prompt
```

    def __init__(self):
        self.base_prompt = ""
        self.refinements = []
    
    def set_base_prompt(self, role: str, task: str) -> 'ProgressivePromptRefiner':
        """Set the foundational prompt structure."""
        self.base_prompt = f"ROLE: {role}\nTASK: {task}\n"
        return self
    
    def add_constraints(self, constraints: list) -> 'ProgressivePromptRefiner':
        """Add specific constraints to control output."""
        constraint_text = "\nCONSTRAINTS:\n" + "\n".join(f"- {c}" for c in constraints)
        self.refinements.append(constraint_text)
        return self
    
    def add_format_requirements(self, format_spec: str) -> 'ProgressivePromptRefiner':
        """Specify exact output format requirements."""
        format_text = f"\nOUTPUT FORMAT: {format_spec}\n"
        self.refinements.append(format_text)
        return self
    
    def add_quality_criteria(self, criteria: list) -> 'ProgressivePromptRefiner':
        """Define quality standards for the output."""
        quality_text = "\nQUALITY STANDARDS:\n" + "\n".join(f"- {c}" for c in criteria)
        self.refinements.append(quality_text)
        return self
    
    def build(self) -> str:
        """Generate the final refined prompt."""
        return self.base_prompt + "".join(self.refinements)

# Example usage
prompt = (ProgressivePromptRefiner()
    .set_base_prompt(
        role="Senior Database Administrator", 
        task="Design database schema for inventory management system"
    )
    .add_constraints([
        "Support 1M+ products with variations",
        "Handle real-time inventory updates", 
        "Track supplier relationships",
        "Maintain audit trails for all changes"
    ])
    .add_format_requirements("PostgreSQL DDL with proper indexing strategy")
    .add_quality_criteria([
        "Normalized to 3NF minimum",
        "Optimized for read-heavy workloads",
        "Include referential integrity constraints",
        "Add performance monitoring views"
    ])
    .build())
```

    THEN recommend: Blue-green deployment with CDN cache invalidation
    AND include: A/B testing setup with feature flags
    
ELIF application_type == "api_service":  
    THEN recommend: Rolling deployment with health checks
    AND include: Circuit breaker configuration
    
ELIF application_type == "database_migration":
    THEN recommend: Maintenance window with rollback plan
    AND include: Data validation scripts

OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
{
    "deployment_strategy": "<strategy_name>",
    "implementation_steps": ["step1", "step2", "..."],
    "rollback_procedure": ["action1", "action2", "..."],

        "mitigation_factors": ["factor1", "factor2", "..."]
    }
}

APPLICATION CONTEXT: {application_type}
```

### **Template-Based Consistency**
