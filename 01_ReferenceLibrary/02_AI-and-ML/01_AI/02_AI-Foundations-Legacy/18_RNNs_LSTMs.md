# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks designed to process sequential data by maintaining internal state (memory) that can capture information from previous time steps. This makes them particularly effective for tasks involving temporal dependencies and variable-length sequences.

## 1. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

### 1.1. Core Concept

RNNs process sequences by maintaining a hidden state that gets updated at each time step:

```text
h_t = f(W_hh * h_{t-1} + W_xh * x_t + b_h)
y_t = W_hy * h_t + b_y
```

Where:

- **h_t:** Hidden state at time t
- **x_t:** Input at time t  
- **y_t:** Output at time t
- **W_hh, W_xh, W_hy:** Weight matrices
- **b_h, b_y:** Bias vectors
- **f:** Activation function (typically tanh or ReLU)

### 1.2. Key Characteristics

#### Memory Mechanism

- **Hidden State:** Carries information from previous time steps
- **Parameter Sharing:** Same weights used across all time steps
- **Variable Length:** Can handle sequences of different lengths

#### Processing Patterns

- **One-to-One:** Traditional feedforward network
- **One-to-Many:** Image captioning (image → text sequence)
- **Many-to-One:** Sentiment analysis (text sequence → classification)
- **Many-to-Many:** Machine translation, speech recognition

### 1.3. Training: Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

RNNs are trained using BPTT, an extension of backpropagation for sequences:

1. **Forward Pass:** Compute outputs for entire sequence
2. **Loss Calculation:** Compare outputs with targets
3. **Backward Pass:** Compute gradients by unrolling the network through time
4. **Parameter Update:** Update weights using accumulated gradients

### 1.4. Challenges with Vanilla RNNs

#### Vanishing Gradient Problem

- Gradients diminish exponentially through long sequences
- Early time steps receive minimal learning signal
- Limits ability to capture long-term dependencies

#### Exploding Gradient Problem

- Gradients grow exponentially, causing unstable training
- Mitigation: Gradient clipping, careful initialization

#### Limited Memory

- Hidden state must compress all relevant history
- Information from distant past gets overwritten

## 2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

### 2.1. Architecture Overview

LSTMs address RNN limitations through a sophisticated gating mechanism:

#### Core Components

- **Cell State (C_t):** Long-term memory pathway
- **Hidden State (h_t):** Short-term memory and output
- **Three Gates:** Control information flow

### 2.2. LSTM Gates

#### Forget Gate

Determines what information to discard from cell state:

```text
f_t = σ(W_f · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
```

#### Input Gate

Controls what new information to store:

```text
i_t = σ(W_i · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
C̃_t = tanh(W_C · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)
```

#### Output Gate

Determines what parts of cell state to output:

```text
o_t = σ(W_o · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)
```

### 2.3. LSTM Cell State Update

The cell state is updated through gated operations:

```text
C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * C̃_t
h_t = o_t * tanh(C_t)
```

This allows:

- **Selective Memory:** Keep relevant information, forget irrelevant
- **Gradient Flow:** Direct pathway for gradient propagation
- **Long-term Dependencies:** Maintain information across long sequences

### 2.4. LSTM Variants

#### Bidirectional LSTM

- Processes sequence in both forward and backward directions
- Combines information from past and future contexts
- Useful when entire sequence is available

#### Deep LSTM

- Multiple LSTM layers stacked vertically
- Each layer learns different levels of abstraction
- Higher layers capture more complex patterns

#### Peephole Connections

- Gates can observe cell state directly
- Provides more precise control over information flow

## 3. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

### 3.1. Simplified Architecture

GRUs combine forget and input gates into a single update gate:

#### Reset Gate

```text
r_t = σ(W_r · [h_{t-1}, x_t])
```

#### Update Gate

```text
z_t = σ(W_z · [h_{t-1}, x_t])
```

#### Candidate Hidden State

```text
h̃_t = tanh(W · [r_t * h_{t-1}, x_t])
```

#### Final Hidden State

```text
h_t = (1 - z_t) * h_{t-1} + z_t * h̃_t
```

### 3.2. GRU vs LSTM
