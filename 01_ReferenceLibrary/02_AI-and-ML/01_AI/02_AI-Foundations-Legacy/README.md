# AI Foundations (Legacy Placeholder)

This placeholder resolves legacy links to `04_AI/AI/AIFoundations/README.md`.

Planned future consolidation:

- Merge overlapping foundational AI concepts into the modern `03_ReferenceLibrary/02_AI-and-ML/01_AI` track.
- De-duplicate ethics, governance, and fundamentals pages.
- Introduce a linear "Foundations → Applied → Advanced" progression.

Proposed sections:

1. Core Concepts & Definitions
2. Historical Evolution of AI
3. Knowledge Representation & Search (brief)
4. Probability & Uncertainty Basics
5. Machine Learning Overview (bridge section)
6. Responsible & Ethical AI Fundamentals
7. Evaluation & Metrics (classification, regression, generative)

Status: Content pending migration and curation.

"Coming soon".
