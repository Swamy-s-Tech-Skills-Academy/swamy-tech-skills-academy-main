# Vector Databases

Vector databases are specialized databases designed for efficient storage, indexing, and querying of high-dimensional vectors. They are optimized for similarity search, enabling fast retrieval of the most relevant vectors to a given query.

## 1. Key Features of Vector Databases

### 1.1. High-Dimensional Support

Efficiently handles vectors with hundreds or thousands of dimensions, supporting common embedding sizes:

- **Text embeddings:** 384-1536 dimensions (e.g., Sentence-BERT, OpenAI embeddings)
- **Image embeddings:** 512-2048 dimensions (e.g., ResNet, CLIP)
- **Custom embeddings:** Variable dimensions based on domain requirements

### 1.2. Optimized for Similarity Search

Employs specialized indexing structures and algorithms, including:

- **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)** algorithms:
  - **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds):** Graph-based index with excellent recall-speed trade-offs
  - **FAISS:** Facebook's similarity search library with CPU/GPU optimization
  - **Annoy:** Spotify's library optimized for static datasets
  - **IVF (Inverted File):** Clustering-based approach for large-scale datasets
  - **LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing):** Probabilistic approach for approximate matching

### 1.3. Scalability and Performance

Designed to handle massive datasets with optimized performance:

- **Horizontal scaling:** Distribute vectors across multiple nodes
- **Sharding strategies:** Partition data for parallel processing
- **Caching mechanisms:** In-memory storage for frequently accessed vectors

- **Low-latency queries:** Sub-millisecond response times for real-time applications

### 1.4. Metadata Filtering

Allows filtering search results based on metadata:

- **Hybrid search:** Combine vector similarity with traditional filters
- **Faceted search:** Multi-dimensional filtering capabilities
- **Range queries:** Filter by numerical metadata ranges
- **Text matching:** Combine with keyword-based searches

## 2. How Vector Databases Work

### 2.1. Data Ingestion Process

3. **Metadata Association:** Link vectors with relevant attributes (IDs, timestamps, categories)
4. **Batch Processing:** Optimize insertions through batching for performance

### 2.2. Indexing Strategies

1. **Index Selection:** Choose appropriate algorithm based on dataset size and query patterns
2. **Parameter Tuning:** Optimize for recall vs. speed trade-offs
3. **Index Building:** Construct optimized data structures for similarity search
4. **Index Maintenance:** Handle updates, deletions, and incremental additions

### 2.3. Query Processing

1. **Query Vector Input:** Receive search vector and optional filters
2. **Similarity Computation:** Calculate distances using metrics like:
   - **Cosine Similarity:** Measures angle between vectors (most common)
   - **Euclidean Distance:** Straight-line distance in vector space
   - **Dot Product:** Inner product for normalized vectors
   - **Manhattan Distance:** Sum of absolute differences
3. **Ranking:** Order results by similarity scores
4. **Result Filtering:** Apply metadata constraints and return top-k results
