# Semantic search

`Semantic search` is a search technique that goes beyond traditional keyword-based search by understanding the intent, context, and meaning behind a user’s query. It leverages `natural language processing (NLP)`, `machine learning`, and sometimes `knowledge graphs` to provide more relevant and accurate results.

## 1. Key Features of Semantic Search

### 1.1. `Understanding Context`

> 1. It considers the query's context instead of just matching exact words.
> 1. For example, a query like _"How do I bake a cake?"_ would return results about cake recipes, even if the exact phrase doesn’t appear in the content.

### 1.2. `Synonym Matching`

> 1. Recognizes synonyms and related terms. For example, "buy car" and "purchase automobile" would yield similar results.

### 1.3. `Entity Recognition`

> 1. Identifies entities in the query (e.g., people, places, products) and relates them to known concepts.
> 1. Example: Searching for _"best phones by Apple"_ returns results related to iPhones.

### 1.4. `Contextual Relevance`

> 1. Uses the user's history, location, and preferences to tailor results.
> 1. For example, _"restaurants near me"_ considers the user’s geographic location.

### 1.5. `Natural Language Queries`

> 1. Handles conversational or long-tail queries like _"What’s the tallest building in the world?"_.

## 2. How Semantic Search Works

### 2.1. `Query Analysis`

> 1. The system breaks down the query into its components (keywords, intent, and context).

### 2.2. `Knowledge Representation`

> 1. It might use a `knowledge graph` to map relationships between entities (e.g., Google’s Knowledge Graph).

### 2.3. `Similarity Matching`

> 1. Utilizes vector embeddings (via machine learning models) to find content semantically similar to the query, even if it doesn’t match exact words.

### 2.4. `Relevance Ranking`

> 1. Results are ranked based on how well they match the query intent and context.

## 3. Technologies Behind Semantic Search

## 3.1. `Natural Language Processing (NLP)`

> 1. Analyzes and interprets human language.

## 3.2. `Word Embeddings`

> 1. Tools like `Word2Vec`, `BERT`, or `GPT` convert words into multi-dimensional vectors to measure semantic similarity.

## 3.3. `Knowledge Graphs`

> 1. Represent relationships between entities (e.g., movies, actors, and genres).

## 3.4. `Deep Learning Models`

> 1. Train on large datasets to understand patterns in language.

## 4. Applications of Semantic Search

## 4.1. `Search Engines`

> 1. Google and Bing use semantic search for smarter results.

## 4.2. `E-commerce`

> 1. Provides personalized product recommendations (e.g., "best headphones under $100").

## 4.3. `Enterprise Search`

> 1. Helps employees find documents, policies, and information more effectively.

## 4.4. `Customer Support`

> 1. Chatbots and virtual assistants use semantic search to retrieve relevant answers.

## 5. Example of `Semantic Search`

> 1. `Query`: _"How can I improve my fitness?"_
> 1. `Traditional Search`: Matches documents containing keywords like _"improve fitness"_.
> 1. `Semantic Search`: Returns results about exercise plans, diet tips, and gym routines by understanding intent and context.

Semantic search makes finding information more intuitive, efficient, and user-focused, aligning search results with real-world meanings and user expectations.
