> Note: Canonical file name is `README.md`.

This file exists only for case-insensitive filesystems. Please use the canonical document:

- [README.md](./README.md)

Why this pointer exists:

- Some tools surface `ReadMe.md` instead of `README.md` on Windows
- We standardize on `README.md` across the repository
