# 02_LSTM

Learning Level: Intermediate  
Prerequisites: RNN basics  
Estimated Time: 25–35 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the intuition behind gated memory
- Identify the input/forget/output gates and cell state role
- Recognize when LSTMs still make sense today

## Conceptual Foundation

LSTMs add a cell state and gates that regulate information flow, enabling longer effective memory than vanilla RNNs.

## Common Pitfalls

- Overly large hidden sizes without regularization
- Training instability without gradient clipping
