## Add users to Azure SQL Database

To add Azure AD users to an Azure SQL Database, you can use the following SQL commands:

```sql
CREATE USER [app-schoolapi-dev-001] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA = dbo;
ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER [app-schoolapi-dev-001];
ALTER ROLE db_datawriter ADD MEMBER [app-schoolapi-dev-001];
ALTER ROLE db_ddladmin ADD MEMBER [app-schoolapi-dev-001];
GO

CREATE USER [school-api] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA = dbo;
ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER [school-api];
ALTER ROLE db_datawriter ADD MEMBER [school-api];
ALTER ROLE db_ddladmin ADD MEMBER [school-api];
GO
```

### Retrieving Users in Azure SQL Database

To retrieve Azure SQL users, including those created from Azure AD, use the following queries:

### 1. **View All Database Users**:

List all users in the current database by querying the **`sys.database_principals`** view:

```sql
SELECT name, type_desc, principal_id
FROM sys.database_principals
WHERE type IN ('S', 'E', 'X')
ORDER BY name;
```

- `S`: SQL users (local)
- `E`: External users (Azure AD users/groups)
- `X`: External groups (Azure AD groups)

This query will list all users, including those created from an external provider (Azure AD).

### 2. **View Only External Users**:

To see only the external users (Azure AD users), you can run:

```sql
SELECT name, type_desc, principal_id
FROM sys.database_principals
WHERE type_desc = 'EXTERNAL_USER'
ORDER BY name;
```

### 3. **Check User Roles and Permissions**:

To check the roles and permissions assigned to a particular user:

```sql
SELECT dp.name AS user_name,
       r.name AS role_name
FROM sys.database_principals dp
JOIN sys.database_role_members drm ON dp.principal_id = drm.member_principal_id
JOIN sys.database_principals r ON r.principal_id = drm.role_principal_id
WHERE dp.type_desc = 'EXTERNAL_USER'
ORDER BY dp.name;
```

This will display all users with their assigned database roles.

### 4. **List Server-Level Users**:

For server-level logins, including Azure AD admins, you can query the **`sys.server_principals`** view:

```sql
SELECT name, type_desc, principal_id
FROM sys.server_principals
WHERE type IN ('S', 'E', 'X')
ORDER BY name;
```

### Summary of Key Views:

- **`sys.database_principals`**: Displays user details within the database.
- **`sys.server_principals`**: Lists users/logins at the server level.
- **`EXTERNAL_USER`**: Filters for Azure AD users.

These queries help you manage and retrieve users, particularly those created using Azure AD integration in Azure SQL Database.
