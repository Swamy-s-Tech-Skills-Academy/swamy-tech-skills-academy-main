To maintain the principles of Clean Architecture and ensure that both the WebAPI and Infrastructure layers can use the `RetrievalConfiguration` class, you should move this class to a layer that is accessible to both. The Shared Kernel is an ideal place for such shared concerns.

Here’s how you can achieve this:

1. **Move `RetrievalConfiguration` to the Shared Kernel**:
   - Create a new folder or namespace within the `Solution.SharedKernel` project for configurations if it doesn't already exist.
   - Move the `RetrievalConfiguration` class to this new location.
2. **Update References**:
   - Update the references in both the `Solution.WebAPI` and `Solution.Infrastructure` projects to point to the new location of `RetrievalConfiguration`.

Here’s a step-by-step outline:

### Step 1: Move `RetrievalConfiguration`

Move `RetrievalConfiguration` from `Solution.WebAPI` to `Solution.SharedKernel`:

```markdown
Solution.sln  
├── Solution.Domain  
├── Solution.Application  
├── Solution.Infrastructure  
├── Solution.WebAPI  
└── Solution.SharedKernel  
 └── Configurations // New folder for configuration classes  
 └── RetrievalConfiguration.cs
```

### Step 2: Update `RetrievalConfiguration` Namespace

Update the namespace of the `RetrievalConfiguration` class to reflect its new location. For example:

```csharp
namespace Solution.SharedKernel.Configurations
{
    public class RetrievalConfiguration
    {
        // Configuration properties go here
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Update References in `ServiceCollectionExtension.cs`

In `ServiceCollectionExtension.cs` within the `Solution.Infrastructure` project, update the using statement to reference the new namespace:

```csharp
using Solution.SharedKernel.Configurations;

public static class ServiceCollectionExtensions
{
    public static IServiceCollection AddCustomServices(this IServiceCollection services, RetrievalConfiguration config)
    {
        // Use the config to load different strategy implementations
        // ...
        return services;
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Update References in `Solution.WebAPI`

In the `Solution.WebAPI` project, update the using statement wherever `RetrievalConfiguration` is used:

```csharp
using Solution.SharedKernel.Configurations;

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        var dataRetrievalConfig = Configuration.GetSection("DataRetrieval").Get<RetrievalConfiguration>();
        services.AddCustomServices(dataRetrievalConfig);
    }
}
```

### Final Structure

Your final project structure should look like this:

```markdown
Solution.sln  
├── Solution.Domain  
├── Solution.Application  
├── Solution.Infrastructure  
├── Solution.WebAPI  
└── Solution.SharedKernel  
 └── Configurations  
 └── RetrievalConfiguration.cs
```

By moving the `RetrievalConfiguration` to the Shared Kernel, you ensure that it is accessible to both the WebAPI and Infrastructure layers while maintaining a clean separation of concerns and adhering to the principles of Clean Architecture.

## Q2

Here's the complete `.yml` file with the `build-mode` defined for C# and JavaScript/TypeScript as per your requirements. I've added appropriate logic for handling automatic and manual builds:

```yaml
name: "CodeQL Advanced"

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]
  schedule:
    - cron: "42 6 * * 2"

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze (${{ matrix.language }})
    runs-on: ${{ (matrix.language == 'swift' && 'macos-latest') || 'ubuntu-latest' }}
    permissions:
      security-events: write
      packages: read
      actions: read
      contents: read

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
          - language: "csharp"
            build-mode: "automatic"  # Automatic build mode for C#
          - language: "javascript-typescript"
            build-mode: "none"  # No build required for JavaScript/TypeScript

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Initialize CodeQL
        uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
        with:
          languages: ${{ matrix.language }}
          build-mode: ${{ matrix.build-mode }}

      # For manual build mode, specify your custom build commands.
      - if: matrix.build-mode == 'manual'
        shell: bash
        run: |
          echo 'Manual build mode is selected for ${matrix.language}.'
          echo 'Insert the required build commands here, for example:'
          echo '  dotnet build for C# or another build tool for other languages.'
          exit 1

      # Perform the analysis
      - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
        with:
          category: "/language:${{ matrix.language }}"
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Matrix Definition:**
   - **C# (csharp):** `build-mode: "automatic"` is used to let CodeQL automatically detect and build the project using the `.NET` build process.
   - **JavaScript/TypeScript (javascript-typescript):** `build-mode: "none"` is used since JavaScript/TypeScript don't require a build step for analysis.

2. **Conditional Manual Build Handling:**
   - If any language requires manual build instructions, you can add them to the step under `matrix.build-mode == 'manual'`. For now, it outputs a placeholder message (`echo` commands) to remind you where to insert your build logic.

3. **Analysis Step:**
   - The `Perform CodeQL Analysis` step is the final step that runs the analysis for the given language after initialization.

This `.yml` file is ready to be used in your repository's GitHub Actions workflow for performing CodeQL analysis on C# and JavaScript/TypeScript code with the necessary `build-mode` settings.
