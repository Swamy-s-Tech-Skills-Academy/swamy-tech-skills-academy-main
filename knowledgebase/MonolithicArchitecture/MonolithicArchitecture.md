# All-In-One Architecture (Monolithic Architecture)

## Overview of All-In-One (Monolithic) Architecture

All-In-One Architecture, commonly known as **Monolithic Architecture**, refers to a software architecture pattern where an entire application is built as a single, unified unit. In this type of architecture, all components (user interface, business logic, data access, etc.) are tightly coupled and run as a single process.

Monolithic architectures are simple and straightforward to build and deploy, making them a good starting point for small applications. However, as the application grows, this design can lead to challenges with maintainability, scalability, and deployment flexibility.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Single Codebase**: All application modules (e.g., UI, business logic, database access) are part of the same codebase.
2. **Unified Deployment**: The entire application is deployed as a single unit; any update requires redeploying the entire application.
3. **Tightly Coupled**: Different components of the system are directly dependent on each other, which can create difficulties when scaling or making changes to specific parts.
4. **Simple to Develop**: Development is usually easier and faster in the initial stages due to the lack of inter-service communication and simpler infrastructure needs.

## Solution Layout

Here’s an example solution layout for an All-In-One (Monolithic) Architecture in C# and .NET 8:

```text
Solution.sln
├── Solution.Domain              // Business Entities, Value Objects, Domain Logic
├── Solution.Application         // Application Services and Business Use Cases
├── Solution.Infrastructure      // Data Access, External Integrations, APIs
├── Solution.Web                 // Presentation Layer (UI or API)
```

### Overview of Layers

#### **Domain Layer** (`Solution.Domain`)

- **Purpose**: Encapsulates the core business logic and rules. This is where entities, value objects, and domain services reside.
- **Components**:
  - **Entities**: Represent the core business concepts and have unique identities (e.g., `Customer`, `Order`).
  - **Value Objects**: Descriptive objects without unique identities (e.g., `Money`, `Address`).
  - **Domain Services**: Contain domain logic that doesn’t fit neatly within an entity.
- **Dependencies**: This layer is independent of others and should not reference external systems or libraries.

#### **Application Layer** (`Solution.Application`)

- **Purpose**: Coordinates and orchestrates the application's workflows. It serves as the intermediary between the presentation layer and domain logic.
- **Components**:
  - **Use Cases**: Define the application-specific logic for interacting with the domain layer.
  - **DTOs**: Objects that transfer data between layers.
- **Dependencies**: Depends on the Domain Layer.

#### **Infrastructure Layer** (`Solution.Infrastructure`)

- **Purpose**: Contains implementation details for data access and external service interactions.
- **Components**:
  - **Repositories**: Access the database and manage data persistence.
  - **External APIs**: Interfaces for third-party services or internal/external APIs.
- **Dependencies**: Depends on the Domain Layer and Application Layer.

#### **Presentation Layer** (`Solution.Web`)

- **Purpose**: Handles the user interface or API endpoints. This can include an MVC UI or a RESTful API.
- **Components**:
  - **Controllers**: Serve as the entry point for HTTP requests.
  - **Views/ViewModels**: Handle rendering the data to users or API clients.
- **Dependencies**: Relies on the Application Layer.

### Benefits of All-In-One Architecture

1. **Simplicity**: Ideal for small applications where simplicity in design and development is a priority.
2. **Development Speed**: Faster to develop initially since there's no need to manage communication between separate services.
3. **Easier Deployment**: The entire application is packaged and deployed as a single unit, which reduces operational complexity in the early stages.
4. **Integrated Monitoring**: Since everything is within a single process, monitoring and logging can be simpler and more consolidated.

### Drawbacks of All-In-One Architecture

1. **Limited Scalability**: Scaling requires replicating the entire application, even if only certain parts need to handle higher loads.
2. **Tight Coupling**: Changes to one part of the system can inadvertently affect other parts, leading to a higher risk of regression.
3. **Slower Builds**: As the application grows, the single codebase can result in slower build and deployment times.
4. **Challenging Maintenance**: As more developers work on the codebase, changes can become harder to manage, leading to technical debt and maintenance challenges.

### Example: Monolithic Code Structure

```csharp
// Domain Layer: Customer Entity
public class Customer
{
    public Guid Id { get; private set; }
    public string Name { get; private set; }
    public Address Address { get; private set; }

    public Customer(Guid id, string name, Address address)
    {
        Id = id;
        Name = name;
        Address = address;
    }
}

// Infrastructure Layer: Customer Repository
public class CustomerRepository : ICustomerRepository
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _dbContext;

    public CustomerRepository(AppDbContext dbContext)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
    }

    public Customer GetCustomerById(Guid id)
    {
        return _dbContext.Customers.Find(id);
    }
}

// Presentation Layer: CustomerController
public class CustomerController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ICustomerService _customerService;

    public CustomerController(ICustomerService customerService)
    {
        _customerService = customerService;
    }

    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public ActionResult<Customer> GetCustomer(Guid id)
    {
        return _customerService.GetCustomerById(id);
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

While Monolithic Architecture offers simplicity and ease of use for small to medium-sized applications, it can lead to challenges in maintainability and scalability as the application grows. As applications become larger, it is often necessary to break the monolith into smaller, more manageable microservices or adopt other architectural styles to handle increasing complexity. However, for straightforward use cases, an All-In-One approach provides a cost-effective, efficient way to get started.
