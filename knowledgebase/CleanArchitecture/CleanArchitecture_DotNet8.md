# Clean Architecture

## Clean Architecture Overview

Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that promotes a clear separation of concerns, ensuring that each layer of the application has a distinct responsibility. This architecture helps in maintaining a high level of testability, scalability, and maintainability.

### Key Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer should have a specific responsibility.
2. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
3. **Testability**: Business logic can be tested independently of other concerns like data access and presentation.
4. **Flexibility and Maintainability**: Changes in one part of the system should have minimal impact on other parts.

## Solution Layout

Here’s an example solution layout for a Clean Architecture implementation in C# and .NET 8.

```text
Solution.sln
├── Solution.Domain              // Domain Layer (Entities, Interfaces)
├── Solution.Application         // Application Layer (Services, Use Cases, DTOs)
├── Solution.Infrastructure      // Infrastructure Layer (Data Access, External APIs)
├── Solution.WebAPI              // Presentation Layer (Controllers, API)
└── Solution.SharedKernel        // Shared Kernel (Common utilities, Value Objects, etc.)
```

### Overview of Layers

#### **Domain Layer** (`Solution.Domain`)

- **Purpose**: Represents the domain model, which includes entities, value objects, domain services, and domain events.
- **Components**:
  - **Entities**: Core business objects that have unique identities.
  - **Value Objects**: Immutable objects that represent descriptive aspects of the domain.
  - **Domain Services**: Contain domain logic that doesn't naturally fit within an entity or value object.
  - **Interfaces**: Abstractions for repositories and other services.
- **Dependencies**: This layer should not depend on any other layer.

#### **Application Layer** (`Solution.Application`)

- **Purpose**: Contains the use cases and application services that drive the business processes.
- **Components**:
  - **Use Cases**: Orchestrate the flow of data to and from entities, and coordinate user actions.
  - **Services**: Application-specific services that implement use cases.
  - **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Used to transfer data between layers.
- **Dependencies**: Depends only on the Domain layer.

#### **Infrastructure Layer** (`Solution.Infrastructure`)

- **Purpose**: Handles the implementation details such as data access, external service integrations, and messaging.
- **Components**:
  - **Repositories**: Implement data access logic.
  - **External Service Integrations**: API clients, messaging services, etc.
  - **Configurations**: Database configurations, API configurations, etc.
- **Dependencies**: Depends on the Domain and Application layers.

#### **Presentation Layer** (`Solution.WebAPI`)

- **Purpose**: The entry point of the application, typically an ASP.NET Core Web API that exposes endpoints for clients.
- **Components**:
  - **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses, delegate work to application services.
  - **ViewModels**: Represent data to be presented to the user.
  - **Filters, Middlewares**: Handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, etc.
- **Dependencies**: Depends on the Application layer.

#### **Shared Kernel** (`Solution.SharedKernel`)

- **Purpose**: Contains shared code that is common across multiple layers or projects.
- **Components**:
  - **Common Utilities**: Helper classes, extensions, etc.
  - **Value Objects**: That are used across different bounded contexts.
  - **Domain Events**: Events that are of interest to
