# Infrastructure Layer

Yes, you can have services in the Infrastructure Layer that interact with external APIs. These services are typically responsible for handling the technical details of communicating with external systems, such as third-party APIs, databases, messaging systems, or other external resources.

## Few Points

### Purpose of Services in the Infrastructure Layer

The primary purpose of services in the Infrastructure Layer is to encapsulate the implementation details of how your application interacts with external systems. This allows the rest of your application to remain agnostic of these details, promoting a clean separation of concerns.

### Example Structure

Here's how you might structure your project to include services in the Infrastructure Layer:

```
Solution.sln
├── Solution.Core                // Domain Layer (Entities, Interfaces)
├── Solution.Application         // Application Layer (Services, Use Cases, DTOs, Strategies)
│   ├── Services/                // Application services
│   ├── UseCases/                // Use cases (orchestrates services and business logic)
│   ├── Strategies/              // Strategy interfaces and context (for selecting the strategy)
├── Solution.Infrastructure      // Infrastructure Layer (Concrete Implementations)
│   ├── Data/                    // Database access
│   ├── Repositories/            // Repository implementations
│   ├── Strategies/              // Concrete strategies (Azure SQL, Web API)
│   ├── Services/                // Services for external API interactions
│   │   ├── ExternalApiService.cs // Concrete implementation for external API
├── Solution.WebAPI              // Presentation Layer (Controllers, API)
└── Solution.SharedKernel        // Shared Kernel (Common utilities, Value Objects, etc.)
```

### Example Implementation

Let's consider an example where you have a service in the Infrastructure Layer that interacts with an external payment gateway API.

#### Step 1: Define the Service Interface in the Application Layer

```csharp
namespace Solution.Application.Interfaces
{
    public interface IPaymentGatewayService
    {
        Task<PaymentResponseDto> ProcessPayment(PaymentRequestDto paymentRequest);
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement the Service in the Infrastructure Layer

```csharp
namespace Solution.Infrastructure.Services
{
    public class PaymentGatewayService : IPaymentGatewayService
    {
        private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

        public PaymentGatewayService(HttpClient httpClient)
        {
            _httpClient = httpClient;
        }

        public async Task<PaymentResponseDto> ProcessPayment(PaymentRequestDto paymentRequest)
        {
            // Prepare the request
            var requestContent = new StringContent(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(paymentRequest), Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");

            // Call the external API
            var response = await _httpClient.PostAsync("https://api.paymentgateway.com/payments", requestContent);

            // Handle the response
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
            var responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<PaymentResponseDto>(responseContent);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Register the Service in Dependency Injection

In your startup configuration (e.g., `Startup.cs` for ASP.NET Core), register the service with the dependency injection container.

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Other service registrations...

    // Register the HttpClient for PaymentGatewayService
    services.AddHttpClient<IPaymentGatewayService, PaymentGatewayService>();

    // Other configurations...
}
```

### Key Points

- **Encapsulation:** By placing the service implementation in the Infrastructure Layer, you encapsulate the technical details of interacting with the external API, keeping the Application Layer focused on business logic.
- **Dependency Injection:** Utilize dependency injection to manage dependencies, making it easier to swap out implementations or mock services for testing.
- **Interface Segregation:** Define clear interfaces for services in the Application Layer, which the Infrastructure Layer implements. This promotes loose coupling and easier testing
