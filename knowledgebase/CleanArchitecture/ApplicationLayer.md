# Application Layer

In a layered architecture following Domain-Driven Design (DDD), the **Application Layer** and **Infrastructure Layer** each have distinct responsibilities, and strategies within each layer serve different purposes. Let's break down the strategies in both layers:

## Few Points

### Application Layer Strategies

**Purpose:**  
The strategies in the Application Layer are typically concerned with business logic and decision-making processes that can vary based on different contexts or conditions. These strategies define **how** certain tasks should be executed from a business perspective.

**Examples:**

- **Pricing Strategy:** Different strategies for calculating prices (e.g., discount strategies, promotional pricing).
- **Notification Strategy:** Different ways to notify users (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications).
- **Authentication Strategy:** Different methods of user authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT, SAML).  


**Components:**

- **Strategy Interfaces:** Define the contract that various strategy implementations must adhere to.
- **Context:** A class that uses a strategy interface and can switch between different strategy implementations based on the context or configuration.  


**Example:**

```csharp
// Strategy Interface
public interface IPricingStrategy
{
    decimal CalculatePrice(Order order);
}

// Concrete Strategy
public class DiscountPricingStrategy : IPricingStrategy
{
    public decimal CalculatePrice(Order order)
    {
        // Implementation for discount pricing
    }
}

// Context
public class PricingContext
{
    private readonly IPricingStrategy _pricingStrategy;

    public PricingContext(IPricingStrategy pricingStrategy)
    {
        _pricingStrategy = pricingStrategy;
    }

    public decimal GetPrice(Order order)
    {
        return _pricingStrategy.CalculatePrice(order);
    }
}
```

### Infrastructure Layer Strategies

**Purpose:**  
Strategies in the Infrastructure Layer are typically concerned with the **technical implementation** details and how to interact with external systems or resources. These strategies define **where** and **how** data is stored, retrieved, or communicated.

**Examples:**

- **Database Strategy:** Different databases or data storage mechanisms (e.g., SQL Server, MongoDB, Azure Table Storage).
- **Messaging Strategy:** Different messaging platforms (e.g., RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, Kafka).
- **File Storage Strategy:** Different file storage solutions (e.g., local file system, Azure Blob Storage, Amazon S3).  


**Components:**

- **Concrete Implementations:** Actual implementations of the strategy interfaces defined in the Application Layer or other layers.
- **Configuration:** Setup and configuration details required for the strategy implementations.  


**Example:**

```csharp
// Strategy Interface (defined in Application Layer)
public interface IDatabaseStrategy
{
    void SaveData(object data);
}

// Concrete Implementation (defined in Infrastructure Layer)
public class SqlDatabaseStrategy : IDatabaseStrategy
{
    public void SaveData(object data)
    {
        // Implementation for saving data to SQL Server
    }
}

public class MongoDatabaseStrategy : IDatabaseStrategy
{
    public void SaveData(object data)
    {
        // Implementation for saving data to MongoDB
    }
}
```

### Summary of Differences

| **Aspect**     | **Application Layer Strategies**                                 | **Infrastructure Layer Strategies**                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**    | Business logic and decision-making processes                     | Technical implementation details and resource interactions |
| **Examples**   | Pricing, Notification, Authentication                            | Database, Messaging, File Storage                          |
| **Components** | Strategy interfaces, context classes                             | Concrete implementations, configuration                    |
| **Context**    | How certain tasks should be executed from a business perspective | Where and how data is stored, retrieved, or communicated   |

By maintaining this clear separation, you ensure that your application remains modular, making it easier to swap out implementations or strategies without affecting other parts of the system. This adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns is key to building a scalable and maintainable system.
