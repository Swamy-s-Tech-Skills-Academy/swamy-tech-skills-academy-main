# Semantic search

`Semantic search` is a search technique that goes beyond traditional keyword-based search by understanding the intent, context, and meaning behind a user’s query. It leverages `natural language processing (NLP)`, `machine learning`, and sometimes `knowledge graphs` to provide more relevant and accurate results.

## Key Features of Semantic Search

### 1. `Understanding Context`

> 1. It considers the query's context instead of just matching exact words.
> 1. For example, a query like _"How do I bake a cake?"_ would return results about cake recipes, even if the exact phrase doesn’t appear in the content.

### 2. `Synonym Matching`

> 1. Recognizes synonyms and related terms. For example, "buy car" and "purchase automobile" would yield similar results.

### 3. `Entity Recognition`

> 1. Identifies entities in the query (e.g., people, places, products) and relates them to known concepts.
> 1. Example: Searching for _"best phones by Apple"_ returns results related to iPhones.

### 4. `Contextual Relevance`

> 1. Uses the user's history, location, and preferences to tailor results.
> 1. For example, _"restaurants near me"_ considers the user’s geographic location.

### 5. `Natural Language Queries`

> 1. Handles conversational or long-tail queries like _"What’s the tallest building in the world?"_.

## How Semantic Search Works

1. `Query Analysis`:
   - The system breaks down the query into its components (keywords, intent, and context).
2. `Knowledge Representation`:
   - It might use a `knowledge graph` to map relationships between entities (e.g., Google’s Knowledge Graph).
3. `Similarity Matching`:
   - Utilizes vector embeddings (via machine learning models) to find content semantically similar to the query, even if it doesn’t match exact words.
4. `Relevance Ranking`:
   - Results are ranked based on how well they match the query intent and context.

### Technologies Behind Semantic Search:

- `Natural Language Processing (NLP)`:
  - Analyzes and interprets human language.
- `Word Embeddings`:
  - Tools like `Word2Vec`, `BERT`, or `GPT` convert words into multi-dimensional vectors to measure semantic similarity.
- `Knowledge Graphs`:
  - Represent relationships between entities (e.g., movies, actors, and genres).
- `Deep Learning Models`:
  - Train on large datasets to understand patterns in language.

### Applications of Semantic Search:

1. `Search Engines`:
   - Google and Bing use semantic search for smarter results.
2. `E-commerce`:
   - Provides personalized product recommendations (e.g., "best headphones under $100").
3. `Enterprise Search`:
   - Helps employees find documents, policies, and information more effectively.
4. `Customer Support`:
   - Chatbots and virtual assistants use semantic search to retrieve relevant answers.

### Example:

`Query`: _"How can I improve my fitness?"_  
`Traditional Search`: Matches documents containing keywords like _"improve fitness"_.  
`Semantic Search`: Returns results about exercise plans, diet tips, and gym routines by understanding intent and context.

Semantic search makes finding information more intuitive, efficient, and user-focused, aligning search results with real-world meanings and user expectations.
