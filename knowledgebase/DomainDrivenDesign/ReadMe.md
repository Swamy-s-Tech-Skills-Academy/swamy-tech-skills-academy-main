# Learning Domain Driven Design

`Domain-Driven Design (DDD)` focuses on building software that aligns closely with complex business domains. This guide explores key concepts and principles to help you master DDD.

---

## **Ubiquitous Language**

Ubiquitous language is a common vocabulary shared by both developers and domain experts. It ensures everyone in the project understands the business domain consistently. For example, terms like _Program_, _Schedule_, and _Comment_ in a radio station system must have the same meaning across teams.

---

## **Strategic DDD**

Strategic DDD focuses on high-level decisions about how to design and organize the software system to align with the business domain. It emphasizes understanding the domain, identifying subdomains, and defining boundaries (bounded contexts) to structure the application effectively.

---

## **Domains**

A domain is the problem space or the core area of focus for the application. For instance, in a radio station system, the domain would include _broadcasting_, _program scheduling_, and _user interaction_. Understanding the domain is critical for aligning software with business needs.

---

## **Subdomains**

Subdomains break down the domain into smaller, more manageable parts. There are three types:

1. **Core Subdomain**: The most critical part of the domain, delivering the highest business value.
2. **Supporting Subdomain**: Essential but not the primary focus (e.g., user management).
3. **Generic Subdomain**: Solved problems that can be reused across projects (e.g., payment processing).

---

## **Bounded Contexts**

A bounded context is a logical boundary within which a particular domain model applies. Each context focuses on a specific subdomain and maintains its own rules and language. For example, the _User Context_ may handle authentication, while the _Program Context_ deals with scheduling.

---

## **Bounded Contexts Interaction**

Bounded contexts interact through well-defined integration patterns like:

1. **Shared Kernel**: A common model shared between two contexts.
2. **Anticorruption Layer**: A translation layer that protects one context from changes in another.
3. **Published Language**: Standardized messages used for communication (e.g., events).

These interactions are vital for maintaining decoupled, scalable systems.

---

## **Tactical DDD**

Tactical DDD provides low-level patterns and techniques to implement DDD within a bounded context. It includes building blocks like **entities**, **value objects**, **aggregates**, **repositories**, and **domain services**.

---

## **Aggregates**

An aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that are treated as a single unit. One object, known as the **aggregate root**, ensures consistency and manages access to other objects. For instance, in a program scheduling context, a _Show_ could be an aggregate root that manages _Episodes_.

---

## **Mind Maps**

Mind maps visualize the relationships between domain concepts, subdomains, and bounded contexts. They provide a structured view of how components interact, helping teams align on system architecture.

---

## **Repository Pattern**

The repository pattern abstracts data persistence, allowing the domain model to remain unaware of how data is stored or retrieved. It provides methods like `Add()`, `GetById()`, or `Find()` for managing aggregates.

---

## **Domain Services**

Domain services handle business logic that doesn’t naturally belong to a single entity or value object. For example, calculating the _total listener count_ for a program that spans multiple cities could be implemented in a domain service.

# **Learning Domain-Driven Design**

**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** is a software design approach that emphasizes aligning software models with complex business domains. This guide dives into the core principles, patterns, and structures to help you create scalable and maintainable systems.

---

## **Ubiquitous Language**

Ubiquitous language is the foundation of DDD, ensuring a shared vocabulary between developers and domain experts. By embedding this language into the codebase, teams reduce miscommunication and ensure consistency across the system. For example, terms like _Program_, _Schedule_, and _Broadcast_ in a radio station system must be clear, unambiguous, and consistently used.

---

## **Strategic DDD**

Strategic DDD involves understanding the broader business context and aligning the system architecture with the business goals. Key concepts include:

- **Subdomains**: Core, Supporting, Generic.
- **Bounded Contexts**: Defining the scope of domain models.
- **Context Maps**: Visualizing how bounded contexts interact.

### **Key Patterns in Strategic DDD**

1. **Big Ball of Mud**: Avoiding tightly coupled systems by defining clear boundaries.
2. **Context Maps**: Understanding relationships between bounded contexts (e.g., upstream and downstream systems).
3. **Core Domain Focus**: Prioritize investments in areas of the system with the highest business value.

---

## **Domains**

A domain is the business problem the system is designed to solve. Understanding the domain ensures that software delivers value. Examples include:

- _Healthcare_: Patient management and billing.
- _E-commerce_: Cart management and inventory systems.
- _Radio Broadcasting_: Program scheduling and listener interactions.

---

## **Subdomains**

Subdomains represent different areas of functionality within the domain.

1. **Core Subdomain**: The primary differentiator for the business (e.g., program scheduling in a radio system).
2. **Supporting Subdomain**: Enhances the core but isn’t unique (e.g., user authentication).
3. **Generic Subdomain**: Commonly available solutions (e.g., payment gateways).

### Example for a Radio System:

- **Core Subdomain**: Scheduling and broadcasting programs.
- **Supporting Subdomain**: Managing user interactions (comments, feedback).
- **Generic Subdomain**: Authentication and analytics.

---

## **Bounded Contexts**

Bounded contexts define clear boundaries within the application where a specific domain model applies.  
For example, in a radio station system:

- **User Context**: Manages users, their preferences, and authentication.
- **Program Context**: Manages program details like schedules and descriptions.

Clear boundaries prevent overlaps and ensure scalability.

---

## **Bounded Contexts Interaction**

Bounded contexts interact through well-defined integration mechanisms:

1. **Shared Kernel**: Common code shared between contexts (e.g., shared user IDs).
2. **Anticorruption Layer**: Translates between two contexts to prevent direct dependency.
3. **Published Language**: Agreed-upon formats for data exchange, like events or APIs.

### Example:

In the radio station system, the _User Context_ might publish an event when a user logs in, which the _Analytics Context_ consumes to track engagement.

---

## **Tactical DDD**

Tactical DDD deals with the practical implementation of DDD principles in code.

### **Key Building Blocks**:

1. **Entities**: Objects with unique identities (e.g., _User_, _Program_).
2. **Value Objects**: Immutable objects representing a concept (e.g., _DateTime Range_ for program duration).
3. **Aggregates**: Clusters of domain objects with a root entity.
4. **Domain Services**: Business logic that spans multiple entities or value objects.
5. **Repositories**: Abstractions for data access.

---

## **Aggregates**

Aggregates group related domain objects into a single unit of consistency. An **Aggregate Root** manages all interactions with the aggregate.  
Example:

- **Aggregate Root**: _Program_.
- **Related Objects**: _Schedule_, _Comments_.

This ensures transactional integrity and prevents misuse of internal objects.

---

## **Mind Maps**

Mind maps visually represent domain concepts and their relationships. For example:

- **Core Nodes**: Subdomains, Bounded Contexts, Aggregates.
- **Branches**: Entities, Value Objects, Services, Repositories.

---

## **Repository Pattern**

Repositories abstract the persistence logic, allowing the domain to remain independent of data storage mechanisms.  
Example methods:

- `Add(Program program)`
- `FindById(Guid id)`
- `GetAll()`

---

## **Domain Services**

Domain services encapsulate business logic that doesn’t naturally belong to a single entity.  
Example:

- **Service**: CalculateListenerCount.
- **Responsibility**: Aggregate data from multiple sources to compute the total listeners for a program.

---

## **Event Storming**

A collaborative technique to map out the flow of events in the domain. This helps identify aggregates, domain services, and subdomains.

---

## **Event Sourcing**

Persist domain events instead of current state. This ensures a complete history of changes and allows for rebuilding the current state.

---

## **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**

Separates write operations (commands) from read operations (queries). Useful for systems where read and write patterns have different performance requirements.

---

## **Other Key Concepts**

### **Saga Pattern**

Manages distributed transactions across multiple services by coordinating them using events.

### **Outbox Pattern**

Ensures reliable event publishing by storing events in a database table (the "outbox") and publishing them separately.

### **Value Objects**

Objects that are identified by their attributes rather than a unique ID. Example: _DateRange_ (start and end dates).
