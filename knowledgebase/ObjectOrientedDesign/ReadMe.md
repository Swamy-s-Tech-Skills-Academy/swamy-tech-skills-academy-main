Here's a complete study plan to prepare for Object-Oriented Design (OOD) interview questions, focusing specifically on **interfaces**, **abstraction**, and the other key principles of OOD in C#. This plan covers OOD concepts, code exercises, and practical problem-solving approaches over four weeks, so you can develop a solid foundation.

# OOD Interview Preparation Plan

### **Overview**

This four-week plan will help you master OOD principles, understand design patterns, and practice implementing OOD concepts in C#. Each week has specific goals, topics, and exercises to build and test your understanding progressively.

---

## **Week 1: Core OOD Concepts**

### **Goals**

- Understand the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- Explore and implement **interfaces**, **abstraction**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism** in C#.

### **Topics to Cover**

1. **Introduction to OOP and OOD**
2. **Encapsulation** and **data hiding**
3. **Abstraction**: Abstract classes vs. Interfaces
4. **Interfaces in C#**: Declaring, implementing, and extending interfaces
5. **Polymorphism and Inheritance**: Overriding and virtual methods

### **Exercises**

1. Create classes for a simple inventory management system, with interfaces for **IProduct** (e.g., `AddProduct()`, `RemoveProduct()`) and **ICategory**.
2. Practice creating and implementing an interface for a **PaymentSystem** (e.g., `IPaymentMethod`) with multiple payment methods (`CreditCard`, `PayPal`, etc.).
3. Implement a **Shape** hierarchy, using an `IShape` interface for `Draw()` and `CalculateArea()` methods, and classes like `Circle`, `Rectangle`, etc.

## **Week 2: SOLID Principles and Design Patterns**

### **Goals**

- Learn and apply the **SOLID principles** for better OOD.
- Get familiar with design patterns that leverage interfaces and abstraction.

### **Topics to Cover**

1. **SOLID Principles**:
   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
2. **Key Design Patterns**:
   - **Factory Method** and **Abstract Factory**
   - **Strategy Pattern**
   - **Decorator Pattern**

### **Exercises**

1. **Refactor Code**: Take any simple system (e.g., inventory or user management) and apply SOLID principles to it.
2. **Implement Patterns**:
   - **Strategy Pattern**: Implement a strategy for `IPaymentMethod` to handle multiple payment options without altering the primary payment processing class.
   - **Decorator Pattern**: Create decorators to add additional responsibilities to a `Notification` class, e.g., `SMSNotification`, `EmailNotification`.
3. **ISP Exercise**: Define a large interface, break it down into smaller, more specific interfaces, and refactor classes to implement only what’s necessary.

## **Week 3: Advanced OOD with Real-World Problem-Solving**

### **Goals**

- Practice designing systems with a focus on scalability and maintainability.
- Learn to break down a problem and identify classes, relationships, and interfaces.

### **Topics to Cover**

1. **Abstraction and Modularity**: Identifying abstractions in problem statements.
2. **System Design Principles**: Cohesion, coupling, and modularity.
3. **Common Object-Oriented Design Problems**:
   - Design a Parking Lot system.
   - Design an ATM machine.
   - Design a File System structure.

### **Exercises**

1. **Design a Library System**:
   - Identify key entities (`Book`, `User`, `Library`) and behaviors.
   - Create interfaces for `ILibraryActions` (e.g., `CheckOutBook()`, `ReturnBook()`).
2. **Design a Notification System**:
   - Design interfaces like `INotificationService` for different types of notifications (`Email`, `SMS`, `Push`).
   - Implement classes to use a **Factory pattern** for notification creation.
3. **OOD Case Study**: Pick a problem from a past interview question bank and work through the system design.

## **Week 4: Mock Interviews and Review**

### **Goals**

- Review key concepts and practice live coding.
- Focus on real-time problem-solving and communicating design decisions effectively.

### **Topics to Cover**

1. **Mock Interview Questions**:
   - Practice with mock OOD interview questions.
   - Get comfortable explaining your design decisions clearly and concisely.
2. **Review of SOLID, Design Patterns, and Key Concepts**.
3. **Common Pitfalls and Best Practices in OOD Interviews**:
   - Avoid over-engineering.
   - Focus on flexibility, reusability, and clarity.

### **Exercises**

1. **Mock Interview Questions**:
   - **Design a Movie Booking System**.
   - **Design a Hotel Reservation System**.
2. **Peer Review and Feedback**:
   - Work with peers or mentors to review each other’s code.
   - Focus on code quality, adherence to SOLID, and use of patterns.
3. **Final Review**: Go back over your previous projects, looking for areas to refactor or improve.
