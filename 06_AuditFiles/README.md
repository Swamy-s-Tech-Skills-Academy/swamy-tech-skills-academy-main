# 06_AuditFiles

Temporary, author-facing content audits and migration plans. Not learner-facing; used to coordinate renumbering, link fixes, and content moves.

- Keep active audits here (30â€“90 days typical)
- Prefer a single current audit file; supersede older with a short stub
- When done:
  - Move durable guidance into `03_ReferenceLibrary/02_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md`
  - Convert task lists to GitHub issues or `05_Todos/`
  - Archive any historical notes under `04_LegacyContent/_Backup/`

Note: We avoid the `00_` prefix for long-term files. If a `00_...` audit exists, it should act as a temporary stub pointing to the canonical `01_...` (or later) file during the transition window.
