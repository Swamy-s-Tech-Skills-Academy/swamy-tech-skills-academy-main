DEPRECATED: This TODO scan snapshot has been consolidated into `tools/tools-guide.md` (see Appendix A â€” TODO Scan Report).

If you want this standalone snapshot removed entirely, run:

```powershell
git rm tools/todo-scan-report.md
git commit -m "chore(docs): remove duplicate todo-scan-report.md (merged into tools-guide.md)"
git push
```

Or ask me to commit the removal and I will run the git commands for you.

The authoritative, up-to-date scan is produced by `tools/extract-todos.ps1`.
