# TODO Scan Report (auto-generated snapshot)

Date: 2025-09-17

Summary:

- Total matches found (grep snapshot): 84 (representative sample)
- High-priority areas:
  - `01_ReferenceLibrary/97_Legacy-Migration-Archive/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Legacy/` — many `TODO` items in templates and lesson plans
  - `01_ReferenceLibrary/01_Development/17_Git-Version-Control/` — four files with `## TODO` headings
  - Migration planning files with 'Migration TODO:' markers

Suggested next steps:

1. Run `tools/extract-todos.ps1` to produce an up-to-date CSV of TODO locations.
2. Triage TODOs into issues or move high-priority items into `05_Todos/` for scheduled work.
3. Implement low-effort fixes (stubs, placeholders) for `## TODO` headings to improve reader experience.

Top example files with TODOs:

- `01_ReferenceLibrary/97_Legacy-Migration-Archive/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Legacy/_shared/CodeTemplates/CodeExampleTemplates.md`
- `01_ReferenceLibrary/97_Legacy-Migration-Archive/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Legacy/WeeklyLessons/Week01-BigO-LessonPlan.md`
- `01_ReferenceLibrary/01_Development/17_Git-Version-Control/04_Undo-Strategies.md`
- `01_ReferenceLibrary/01_Development/17_Git-Version-Control/05_Branching-Patterns.md`

Notes:

- This file is a short snapshot created by the assistant during a repository scan. Use `tools/extract-todos.ps1` for a fresh run.
