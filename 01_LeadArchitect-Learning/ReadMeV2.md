# Lead Architect Reimagination Pathway (V2 Clean Slate)

**Learning Level**: Senior Engineer preparing for enterprise-wide architecture ownership  
**Starting Point**: Willingness to reconstruct personal playbooks without relying on prior documentation  
**Estimated Time Commitment**: 9 phases × 36 hours ≈ 324 hours  
**Cadence**: Each phase contains 9 clusters (~4.5 hours each) to fit within focused 36-hour design sprints  
**North Star**: Create a self-authored body of knowledge, assets, and decision frameworks from scratch

## Using This Blueprint

1. Begin every phase by defining the questions you need answered; collect only primary sources you evaluate yourself.  
2. Convert each cluster into a research → experiment → artifact loop so that new material is produced at the end of every 4.5-hour block.  
3. Revisit completed clusters monthly, refine outcomes, and archive superseded artifacts to demonstrate evolution.  
4. Keep this document as the single index; expand with personal notes, diagrams, and repositories created during the journey.
