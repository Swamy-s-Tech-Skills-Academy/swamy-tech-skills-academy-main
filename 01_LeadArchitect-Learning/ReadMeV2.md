# Lead Architect Pathway V2 â€” File Relocation

The clean-slate pathway now lives in a dedicated structure for easier navigation and execution.

- ðŸ“˜ Master index: [`LeadArchitect_Pathway_V2.md`](./LeadArchitect_Pathway_V2.md)
- ðŸ“‚ Phase guides: browse the [`phases/`](./phases/) directory for individual cluster tables and deliverables

Use the master index as your entry point, then open the relevant phase README to work through each 4.5-hour cluster sprint.
