# Lead Architect Progressive Pathway (Clean Slate, V2)

**Learning Level**: Senior Engineer → Lead / Chief Architect  
**Prerequisites**: Multi-language development fluency, baseline DevOps and system design literacy  
**Estimated Time**: 9 phases × 36 hours ≈ 324 hours  
**Structure**: Each phase contains 9 thematic clusters (~4.5 hours per cluster)  
**Builds Upon**: STSA Development track, DevOps pathway, AI/ML foundations  
**Enables**: Enterprise-scale solution design, platform governance, strategic technology leadership

## How to Navigate This Playbook

1. Treat each cluster as a focused 4.5-hour arc: study → practice → artifact.  
2. Use the outputs column to capture tangible evidence (notes, diagrams, repos, decks).  
3. Rotate phases based on business demand; return quarterly to log deltas and reprioritize.  
4. Pair with [`ReadMeV1.md`](./ReadMeV1.md) for 27-minute sprints when you need rapid refreshers.
