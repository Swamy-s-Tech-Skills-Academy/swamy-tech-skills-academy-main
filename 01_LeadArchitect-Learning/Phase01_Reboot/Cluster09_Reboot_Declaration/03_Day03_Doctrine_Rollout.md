# 09A_Day03_Doctrine_Rollout

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Doctrine narrative draft, visual storyboard plan, stakeholder map  
**Estimated Time**: 54 minutes (2 × 27-minute loops)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Tailor doctrine messaging for key stakeholder personas.
- Design rollout plan covering communications, enablement, and governance.

## 🔄 Loop 05 — Stakeholder Messaging Lab (27 minutes)

1. Identify personas (executives, product, engineering, operations, compliance, partners).
2. Create tailored briefs: what changes for them, expected benefits, required commitments.
3. Draft Q&A addressing anticipated objections or clarifications.
4. Determine preferred channels (town hall, newsletter, lead forums, partner syncs).

### Output: Persona Messaging Pack

| Persona | Core Message | Call to Action | Benefits | Channel | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 🔄 Loop 06 — Rollout Plan Blueprint (27 minutes)

1. Sequence launch events (executive preview, all-hands reveal, team-level workshops).
2. Assign facilitation roles, logistics, and enablement assets (playbooks, cheat sheets, videos).
3. Align rollout with operating cadences (QBR, PI planning, release trains).
4. Capture feedback loops (surveys, office hours, retrospective prompts).

### Output: Doctrine Launch Plan

| Milestone | Description | Date | Audience | Format | Owner | Success Metric |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 🧭 Engagement Integrity

- Ensure messaging emphasizes shared ownership; doctrine is co-created, not imposed.
- Plan for reinforcement moments beyond the initial launch.
