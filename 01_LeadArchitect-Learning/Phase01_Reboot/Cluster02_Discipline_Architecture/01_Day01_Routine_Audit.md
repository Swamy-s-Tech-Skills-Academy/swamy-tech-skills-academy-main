# 02B_Day01_Routine_Audit

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Week 02 overview, personal calendar for past 2 weeks, performance dashboard access  
**Estimated Time**: 2 × 27-minute loops

## 🎯 Objectives for Today

- Surface the unspoken defaults that currently govern your daily execution.
- Capture strengths, gaps, and friction points across focus, delivery, learning, and relationships.
- Gather exemplar evidence from teams that consistently perform with discipline.

## ⏱️ Loop Map

| Loop | Focus | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | Personal routine audit | Routine inventory canvas |
| 02 | External benchmark scan | Benchmark dossier |

## 🧭 Loop 01 – Personal Routine Audit

**Target Output**: Routine inventory canvas capturing 24-hour flow, energy peaks, interruptions, and accountability partners.

### Step-by-step (Loop 01)

1. Export the last two weeks of calendar events and tag each item under the quartet: Focus, Delivery, Learning, Relationships.
2. Layer Git/GitHub, incident, and review data to see where time was actually invested versus scheduled.
3. Note moments of flow, friction, and avoidable context switching—color-code high vs. low leverage blocks.
4. Record existing rituals (stand-ups, reviews, async check-ins) and grade their effectiveness (0–5).

### Prompts & Cheatsheet

- Which habits would you defend if tomorrow went sideways?
- Where did “urgent” work displace “important” work over the last fortnight?
- Which rituals reliably reset you when chaos spikes?

## 🔍 Loop 02 – External Benchmark Scan

**Target Output**: Benchmark dossier summarizing 3 high-performing leaders/teams and their discipline patterns.

### Step-by-step (Loop 02)

1. Select three exemplars (internal or public) known for relentless execution discipline.
2. For each, capture their observable rituals (daily stand-ups, async updates, code review SLAs, guardrails).
3. Identify supporting assets—blog posts, playbooks, dashboards—that hint at how they sustain consistency.
4. Extract “micro-moves” you can adapt (e.g., 15-minute async review window, Friday automation block).

## ✅ Exit Criteria for Day 1

- Routine inventory canvas completed with honest appraisal of leverage points and drains.
- Benchmark dossier highlighting at least three transferable habits.
- Shortlist of “discipline gaps” to bring into Day 2 principle crafting.

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources

- Calendar export or analytics (Outlook, Google Workspace, Clockwise).
- Engineering metrics dashboards (DORA, custom Git analytics, PagerDuty timelines).
- Internal knowledge base entries on elite teams.

## 🔄 Handoff to Day 2

- Park routine gaps and benchmark insights in the Week 02 parking lot.
- Flag any quick wins you can implement immediately (e.g., blocking deep work slots).
- Bring the evidence matrix to Day 2 to inform the principle forge session.
