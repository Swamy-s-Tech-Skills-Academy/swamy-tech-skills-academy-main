# Day 4 – Calibration Lab (Loops 07-08)

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Perspective Reset Letter draft, Commitment Web, stakeholder meeting invites  
**Estimated Time**: 54 minutes (2 × 27-minute loops)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Integrate feedback from mentors, peers, or AI partners to sharpen commitments and rituals.
- Tune measurement plans and adoption rituals so they are observable, sustainable, and team-owned.

## 🧭 Session Agenda

| Segment | Duration | Activity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pulse check | 5 min | Review emotional notes and ally availability |
| Loop 07 | 27 min | Feedback studio: run critique sessions and log deltas |
| Break | 2 min | Reset, stretch |
| Loop 08 | 27 min | Metric & ritual calibration plus risk countermeasures |
| Wrap | 5 min | Confirm revisions and prep Day 5 run of show |

## 📣 Loop 07 – Feedback Studio

Recommended sequence:

1. **Mentor Review (10 min)** – Walk through ARC narrative; capture headline deltas.
2. **Peer Council (10 min)** – Ask technology leads to challenge feasibility of rituals and metrics.
3. **AI Companion (7 min)** – Use an AI critique checklist for tone, clarity, and bias.

Capture output in the Feedback Ledger:

| Source | Delta Requested | Decision (Accept/Adapt/Decline) | Follow-up Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 📏 Loop 08 – Metric & Ritual Calibration

Use the *Adoption Flywheel* to ensure every ritual leads to data and accountability.

```text
[Ritual] -> [Observable Behavior] -> [Metric Capture] -> [Review Cadence] -> [Adjustment Trigger]
       ↳ ensure owner, channel, and artifact are explicit
```

Checklist:

- ✅ Each ritual has a named owner, audience, and cadence.
- ✅ Metrics combine leading and lagging indicators (e.g., council attendance + decision latency).
- ✅ Risks include fallback plans (e.g., if council attendance < 80%, trigger 1:1 outreach).
- ✅ Document open questions requiring executive sponsorship.

## ⚠️ Watch-outs

- **Feedback whiplash**: Prioritize deltas aligned with Week 01 objectives; avoid endless iteration.
- **Invisible metrics**: If data cannot be collected within existing systems, either instrument it today or rework the metric.
- **Owner ambiguity**: Every ritual without a single accountable owner will stall—assign by name.

## 🔄 Handoff to Day 5

- Produce the updated Perspective Reset Letter v0.9 and note outstanding deltas.
- Draft the Day 5 run of show (audience, channel, timing, success metric targets).
- Confirm that support moves (ally amplifications, coaching sessions) are scheduled.
