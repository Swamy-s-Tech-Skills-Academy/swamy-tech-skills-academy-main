# 04D_Day03_Scenario_Lab

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Heuristic set v0, constraint ledger, incident and scaling scenarios  
**Estimated Time**: 2 × 27-minute loops

## 🎯 Objectives for Today

- Validate heuristics against realistic scenarios to ensure they trigger the right actions.
- Audit cognitive biases that might distort judgment when applying the heuristics.

## ⏱️ Loop Map

| Loop | Focus | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 05 | Scenario simulation | Scenario playbook entries |
| 06 | Bias audit | Cognitive bias checklist |

## 🎬 Loop 05 – Scenario Simulation

**Target Output**: Scenario playbook entries capturing how each heuristic performs under pressure.

### Step-by-step (Loop 05)

1. Select three scenarios: **Incident Recovery**, **Hyper-Growth Launch**, **Cost Optimization Mandate**.
2. For each scenario, walk through the system map and apply relevant heuristics step by step.
3. Document outcomes, required data, decision checkpoints, and hand-offs.
4. Record gaps where heuristics need refinement or additional signals.

## 🧭 Loop 06 – Bias Audit

**Target Output**: Cognitive bias checklist detailing risks and countermeasures per heuristic.

### Step-by-step (Loop 06)

1. Review heuristics for susceptibility to common biases (confirmation, recency, sunk cost, anchoring).
2. For each bias, note indicators that the bias is surfacing and a counter-move (additional data, escalation, timeout).
3. Incorporate bias checks into the playbook entries where relevant.
4. Prioritize training or reinforcement tactics to mitigate top biases.

## ✅ Exit Criteria for Day 3

- Scenario playbook entries for at least three scenarios completed.
- Cognitive bias checklist populated with countermeasures.
- Clear list of heuristics requiring peer validation tomorrow.

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources

- Incident retrospectives, release postmortems, and strategy docs.
- Facilitation templates for scenario planning workshops.
- Behavioral science references on cognitive bias mitigation.

## 🔄 Handoff to Day 4

- Share scenario outcomes with peer reviewers and executives for feedback.
- Flag heuristics needing rewording or additional guardrails.
- Prepare storytelling cues (narratives, visuals) for the storyboard wireframe.
