# 07A_Day03_Guardrail_Enforcement

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Guardrail definition worksheet, automation tool access  
**Estimated Time**: 54 minutes (2 Ã— 27-minute loops)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Translate guardrail definitions into actionable enforcement controls.
- Leverage tooling and automation to minimize manual oversight.
- Document remediation workflows and accountability hand-offs.

## ðŸ”„ Loop 05 â€” Enforcement Blueprint (27 minutes)

1. Determine the ideal enforcement mode for each guardrail (prevent, detect, correct).
2. Specify control type: policy-as-code, CI/CD gate, monitoring alert, review checklist.
3. Identify required integrations (GitHub, Azure DevOps, ServiceNow, SIEM, etc.).
4. Draft a remediation workflow outlining who responds, within what timeframe.

### Output: Enforcement Blueprint Table

| Guardrail | Control Type | Enforcement Mode | Required Integration | Remediation Owner | SLA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## ðŸ”„ Loop 06 â€” Automation Enablement (27 minutes)

1. Inventory existing automation capabilities (pipelines, bots, scripts) that can enforce guardrails.
2. Define backlog items for missing automation (e.g., policy-as-code rules, automated rollback).
3. Outline telemetry needed to confirm guardrail adherence and surface drift.
4. Align automation backlog with engineering priorities and secure team capacity.

### Output: Automation Enablement Roster

| Guardrail | Automation Candidate | Tooling Hook | Status | Owner | Target Sprint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## ðŸ§­ Control Fitness Check

- Validate that each guardrail has at least one preventive or detective control.
- Ensure remediation workflows include escalation for repeated breaches.

## âœ… Success Criteria

- 100% of priority guardrails mapped to explicit enforcement controls.
- Automation backlog drafted with owners and delivery windows.
- Telemetry requirements captured for visibility and tuning.

## ðŸš§ Watch Outs

- Relying solely on manual reviews for high-risk guardrails.
- Automations without clear owners or maintenance plans.
