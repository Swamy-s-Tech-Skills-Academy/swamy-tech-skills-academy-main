# 06F_Day05_Signal_Brief

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Alignment log, alerting matrix, insight cards, dashboard storyboard  
**Estimated Time**: 2 √ó 27-minute loops

## üéØ Objectives for Today

- Compile the Signal Synthesis Brief v1.0 integrating insights, rituals, and automation plans.
- Define the intelligence rollout roadmap and capture the Week 06 retrospective.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Loop Map

| Loop | Focus | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 09 | Brief drafting | Signal Synthesis Brief v0.9 |
| 10 | Adoption roadmap | Intelligence rollout plan + retrospective brief |

## üì∞ Loop 09 ‚Äì Brief Drafting

**Target Output**: Signal Synthesis Brief v0.9 ready for stakeholder review.

### Step-by-step (Loop 09)

1. Structure the brief: **Executive Summary**, **Signal Library Highlights**, **Rituals**, **Alerting & Automation**, **Integrity Gaps & Roadmap**.
2. Embed insight cards, exemplar stories, and dashboard mock-ups.
3. Summarize alignment decisions and outstanding risks.
4. Define metrics for success (signal adoption rate, decision lead time improvement, incident detection time).

### Brief Skeleton

```text
1. Why Signal Intelligence Matters Now
2. Signal Library Overview
3. Rituals & Decision Cadences
4. Alerting & Automation Blueprint
5. Integrity Gaps & Remediation Plan
6. Metrics & Governance
```

## üöÄ Loop 10 ‚Äì Adoption Roadmap

**Target Output**: Intelligence rollout plan plus Week 06 retrospective brief.

### Step-by-step (Loop 10)

1. Map a 90-day rollout covering dashboard deployment, automation build, and training.
2. Assign owners, milestones, and success measures for each phase.
3. Plan communications (executive updates, team workshops, office hours).
4. Capture Week 06 retrospective insights and forward inputs for Cluster 07 guardrail charter.

### Rollout Plan Table

| Phase | Dates | Focus | Owner | Success Metric |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Retrospective Prompt

```text
Week 06 Retrospective:
- Which signals proved most decision-ready?
- Where do integrity gaps still hinder trust?
- How will alerts change operational behavior?
- What guardrails should Cluster 07 enforce using these signals?
```

## ‚úÖ Exit Criteria for Day 5

- Signal Synthesis Brief v1.0 assembled with narrative, data, and actions.
- Intelligence rollout roadmap with owners and milestones published.
- Retrospective brief completed and handed to guardrail charter squad.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Resources

- Documentation platforms for publishing the brief.
- Project trackers for roadmap execution.
- Communication channels for training and updates.

## üîó Handoff to Cluster 07

- Deliver signal guardrail requirements to the Baseline Guardrail Charter team.
- Provide dashboard and alerting assets for governance integration.
- Outline monitoring checkpoints to ensure guardrails use trusted data.
