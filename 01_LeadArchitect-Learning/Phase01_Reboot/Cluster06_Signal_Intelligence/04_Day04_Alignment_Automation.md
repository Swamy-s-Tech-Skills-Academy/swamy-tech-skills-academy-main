# 06E_Day04_Alignment_Automation

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Analytics cadence map, dashboard storyboard, automation backlog  
**Estimated Time**: 2 × 27-minute loops

## 🎯 Objectives for Today

- Align stakeholders on signal ownership, review cadence, and decisions.
- Plan automation triggers and alerting matrices that keep signals actionable.

## ⏱️ Loop Map

| Loop | Focus | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 07 | Stakeholder alignment | Alignment log |
| 08 | Automation trigger plan | Alerting matrix |

## 🤝 Loop 07 – Stakeholder Alignment

**Target Output**: Alignment log capturing commitments from leaders and teams.

### Step-by-step (Loop 07)

1. Host short alignment sessions with key personas (CTO, Product Ops, Engineering Ops, Data Team).
2. Review cadence map and storyboard, confirming signal ownership and action triggers.
3. Capture agreements, unresolved objections, and required support.
4. Log follow-up tasks and due dates.

### Alignment Log Template

| Stakeholder | Signals Owned | Agreements | Concerns | Action Items | Due Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## ⚙️ Loop 08 – Automation Trigger Plan

**Target Output**: Alerting matrix defining thresholds, channels, and runbooks.

### Step-by-step (Loop 08)

1. For high-priority signals, set alert thresholds (warning, critical) aligned with decision triggers.
2. Choose notification channels (Slack, Teams, PagerDuty) and escalation paths.
3. Attach runbooks or procedures for responding to alerts.
4. Identify automation tasks required (dashboards, scripts, MCP workflows) and assign owners.

## ✅ Exit Criteria for Day 4

- Alignment log populated with stakeholder commitments and action items.
- Alerting matrix defined for critical signals with owners and runbooks.
- Automation requirements queued for implementation.

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources

- Collaboration tools for meetings and notes (Notion, Confluence, Miro).
- Incident management platforms (PagerDuty, Opsgenie).
- Automation workflows (GitHub Actions, Azure Logic Apps, MCP servers).

## 🔄 Handoff to Day 5

- Incorporate alignment feedback into the Signal Synthesis Brief.
- Prepare rollout plan and retrospective cues.
- Confirm automation owners understand next steps.
