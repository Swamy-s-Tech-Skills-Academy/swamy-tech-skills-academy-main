# Lead Architect Reimagination Pathway (V2 Clean Slate)

**Learning Level**: Senior Engineer preparing for enterprise-wide architecture ownership  
**Starting Point**: Willingness to reconstruct personal playbooks without relying on prior documentation  
**Estimated Time Commitment**: 9 phases × 36 hours ≈ 324 hours  
**Cadence**: Each phase contains 9 clusters (~4.5 hours each) to fit within focused 36-hour design sprints  
**North Star**: Create a self-authored body of knowledge, assets, and decision frameworks from scratch

## Using This Blueprint

1. Begin every phase by defining the questions you need answered; collect only primary sources you evaluate yourself.  
2. Convert each cluster into a research → experiment → artifact loop so that new material is produced at the end of every 4.5-hour block.  
3. Revisit completed clusters monthly, refine outcomes, and archive superseded artifacts to demonstrate evolution.  
4. Keep this document as the single index; expand with personal notes, diagrams, and repositories created during the journey.

## Cluster Lattice

| Cluster | Intent | Focus Questions | Evidence to Produce |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | Reset & Mindset | What assumptions should be retired or reframed? | Reflection brief, belief inventory |
| 02 | Practice Crafting | Which new disciplines must be prototyped immediately? | Practice experiments plan |
| 03 | Tooling Forge | Which tools enable leverage for the next horizon? | Tool selection dossier |
| 04 | System Lens | Which systemic effects must be understood end to end? | System sketchbook |
| 05 | Lab Build | How will new approaches be proven rapidly? | Sandbox implementation notes |
| 06 | Evidence Review | What real-world signals validate or invalidate choices? | Insight digest |
| 07 | Guardrails | What protects quality, security, and observability by default? | Guardrail matrix |
| 08 | Frontier Scan | Which frontiers should I test for future-ready capabilities? | Frontier experiment log |
| 09 | Doctrine & Assets | How will I socialize and reuse what I have learned? | Playbook bundle |
