## 📝 What Goes Here

### **Evidence of Learning:**

- Your actual code implementations
- Working examples you've created
- Practical applications you've built
- Problem-solving approaches you've mastered

### **Documented Understanding:**

- Key insights and "aha!" moments
- How concepts apply to real-world scenarios
- Your personal explanations of complex topics
- Decision-making frameworks you've developed

### **NOT What Goes Here:**

- ❌ Plans and intentions
- ❌ Reference materials and templates
- ❌ Theoretical knowledge without application
- ❌ Copy-pasted content from tutorials

## 🎯 Getting Started

1. **Complete Week 1** in your [LearningJourney](../02_LearningJourney/Week-01-OOP.md)
2. **Create `Week-01-OOP-Foundations/`** folder after completing the week
3. **Add your actual implementations** and key learnings
4. **Plan Week 2** only after Week 1 is truly complete

## 📖 Reference Materials

All reference materials, templates, and study guides are available in the [ReferenceLibrary](../03_ReferenceLibrary/) when needed during learning.

**Remember**: This knowledge base grows **one week at a time** based on **real achievements**, not plans. Complete Week 1 first!

**Remember**: This knowledge base should reflect the **true picture** of what you've learned and can actually apply. Quality over quantity!
