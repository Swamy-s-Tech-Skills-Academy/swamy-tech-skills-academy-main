# Lead Architect Knowledge Base

Purpose: This is your portfolio of mastery. Capture completed work, implementations, and evidence of learning.

Getting started:

- Create a dated folder per artifact under domain areas (for example, `AI-NLP/2025-08-11_One-Hot-Encoding/`).
- Include a concise README with objectives, evidence, and links back to Reference Library and Learning Journey notes.
- Keep content original per STSA guidelines.

Next:

- See `../02_LearningJourney/` for active notes.
- Reference materials live in `../03_ReferenceLibrary/`.
