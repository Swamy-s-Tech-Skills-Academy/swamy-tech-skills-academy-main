# 📚 Reference Library

## Purpose

This folder contains all static reference materials, templates, guides, and documentation that support the learning journey. Unlike the Knowledge Base (which documents actual learning achievements) or Learning Journey (which tracks active learning), this is your comprehensive reference library.

## 🔄 Relationship to Other Folders

### **🎯 LearningJourney** (Active Learning)

- Current week planning and tracking
- Daily progress monitoring
- Active skill development

### **📚 LeadArchitectKnowledgeBase** (Proven Knowledge)

- Documented learning achievements
- Mastered concepts and implementations
- Evidence of skill development

### **📚 ReferenceLibrary** (This Folder)

- Static reference materials
- Templates and guides
- Process documentation

## 🎯 Usage Principles

1. **Reference Only**: Content here doesn't change frequently
2. **Support Materials**: Supports active learning and knowledge documentation
3. **Templates First**: Use templates for consistency across learning activities
4. **Quick Access**: Designed for fast lookup and reference during learning
