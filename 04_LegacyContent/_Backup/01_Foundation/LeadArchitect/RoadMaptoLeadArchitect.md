### Practice & Mock Interviews

At the end of each week:

- Schedule a **mock interview** session to practice what you’ve learned. We can simulate questions or system design scenarios based on the week’s topics.
- Reflect on the STAR framework for behavioral questions, especially around leadership and decision-making.

By the end of 30 days, you'll be fully prepared across technical, architectural, and soft skills areas for a Lead Architect interview. Let me know if you'd like specific practice questions, or if there's a topic you'd like more hands-on guidance with! -->
