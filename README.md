# Lead Architect Reimagination Pathway (V2 Clean Slate)

**Learning Level**: Senior Engineer preparing for enterprise-wide architecture ownership  
**Starting Point**: Willingness to reconstruct personal playbooks without relying on prior documentation  
**Estimated Time Commitment**: 9 phases × 36 hours ≈ 324 hours  
**Cadence**: Each phase contains 9 clusters (~4.5 hours each) to fit within focused 36-hour design sprints  
**North Star**: Build a self-authored body of knowledge, assets, and decision frameworks from scratch

## 🏗️ Learning Architecture

This workspace follows a **foundation-first hierarchy**:

- **`01_ReferenceLibrary/`** - Technical knowledge foundation across all domains
- **`02_LeadArchitect-Learning/`** - Strategic pathway applying foundational knowledge

**Learning Flow**: Master technical concepts → Apply strategically → Create architectural leadership artifacts

## How to Use This Blueprint

1. Start every phase by framing the questions you need answered; gather only primary sources you can evaluate yourself.  
2. Treat each cluster as a research → experiment → artifact loop; produce a new tangible output at the end of every 4.5-hour block.  
3. Revisit completed clusters monthly to refine conclusions and retire superseded artifacts; show the evolution deliberately.  
4. Keep this README as the single index; extend it with the notes, diagrams, and code repositories you create on the journey.

## Cluster Lattice

| Cluster | Intent | Focus Questions | Evidence to Produce |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | Reset & Mindset | What assumptions should be retired or reframed? | Reflection brief, belief inventory |
| 02 | Practice Crafting | Which new disciplines must be prototyped immediately? | Practice experiments plan |
| 03 | Tooling Forge | Which tools enable leverage for the next horizon? | Tool selection dossier |
| 04 | System Lens | Which systemic effects must be understood end to end? | System sketchbook |
| 05 | Lab Build | How will new approaches be proven rapidly? | Sandbox implementation notes |
| 06 | Evidence Review | What real-world signals validate or invalidate choices? | Insight digest |
| 07 | Guardrails | What protects quality, security, and observability by default? | Guardrail matrix |
| 08 | Frontier Scan | Which frontiers should I test for future-ready capabilities? | Frontier experiment log |
| 09 | Doctrine & Assets | How will I socialize and reuse what I have learned? | Playbook bundle |

## Operational Rhythms You Can Reuse

    style F fill:#e1f5fe
    style I fill:#ffecb3
```

- **Monday reset**: Calibrate phase questions, reaffirm constraints, and log the last week's evidence you are replacing.  
- **Cluster sprint**: Execute the research → experiment → artifact loop; finish with a published update (even if draft).  
- **Friday doctrine**: Summarize what stays, what changes, and what needs escalation to leadership peers.

### Evidence Lattice Template

```markdown
# Cluster X Artifact Evidence

## 1. Question Framed
- What hypothesis am I testing?
- Stakeholders affected?

## 2. Research Notes
- Primary sources evaluated (link + credibility)
- Contrasting viewpoints considered

## 3. Experiment Log
- Prototype / simulation summary
- Signals captured (metrics, interviews, architecture reviews)

## 4. Artifact Shipped
- URL / repository / diagram location
- Guardrails applied (security, quality, observability)

## 5. Next Review Cycle
- Date of next revisit
- Triggers that would force an earlier review
```

Store the evidence lattice inside the relevant phase folder (for example `02_LeadArchitect-Learning/Phase04_Scale_Systems/Evidence/Cluster05.md`) so that every doctrine entry has traceable proof.

## Support Folders at a Glance

- `01_ReferenceLibrary/` — Technical knowledge foundation across all domains.
- `02_LeadArchitect-Learning/` — Strategic pathway content, organized by phase.  
- `tools/` — PowerShell utilities for daily learning system management.

Use the folders together:

1. Sketch intent and capture outputs in the pathway folder.  
2. Track execution details inside `02_LearningJourney`.  
3. Promote any reusable insight into `03_ReferenceLibrary` once it proves evergreen.  
4. Retire superseded material into `04_LegacyContent` for auditing.

---

## Quick Start for Today

- **Foundation first**: Review technical concepts in `01_ReferenceLibrary/` for your current focus area.
- **Strategic application**: Read the appropriate phase README within `02_LeadArchitect-Learning/`.  
- **Integration**: Connect technical knowledge to strategic architectural decisions.
- **Quality assurance**: Use `tools/` utilities for validation and progress tracking.

## Weekly Retrospective Prompt (Drop-In Snippet)

```markdown
## 📊 Week X Reflection

### Highlights
- Impact move delivered this week
- Architecture trade-off I can now defend

### Guardrail Check
- Security & reliability implications
- Observability + feedback loops adjusted

### Doctrine Updates
- Which doctrine entries changed?
- What new assets were published?

### Forward View

## Quality Gates & Tooling

```powershell
# Targeted markdown lint (will include repo-wide defaults)
npx markdownlint-cli2 "README.md"

# Optional: curated docs lint helper
./tools/docs-lint.ps1

# Link validation
docker run --rm -w /input -v "${PWD}:/input" lycheeverse/lychee:latest --config lychee.toml --no-progress README.md
```

Expect markdownlint to surface pre-existing legacy violations; focus on keeping this README clean and track the broader cleanup separately.
