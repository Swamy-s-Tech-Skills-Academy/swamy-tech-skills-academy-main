## 🔍 Understanding the Four-Pillar System

### **Why Four Folders? Are They Redundant?**

**NO - Each serves a distinct, non-overlapping purpose:**

| Folder                            | Purpose                  | Content Type                                               | When You Use It                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **01_LeadArchitectKnowledgeBase** | **Portfolio of Mastery** | Your completed work, implementations, evidence of learning | When showcasing what you've accomplished and mastered    |
| **02_LearningJourney**            | **Active Workspace**     | Current learning plans, daily tracking, active work        | When you're actively learning and need to track progress |
| **03_ReferenceLibrary**           | **Quick Reference Desk** | Curated materials you actively use                         | When you need quick reference during learning or work    |
| **04_LegacyContent**              | **Complete Archive**     | All original materials and comprehensive resources         | When you need to explore comprehensive materials         |

### **How They Work Together**

```mermaid

    style A fill:#e8f5e8
    style B fill:#e1f5fe
    style C fill:#fff3e0
    style D fill:#f5f5f5
```

### **Typical Learning Workflow**

1. **Plan** your week in `02_LearningJourney`
2. **Reference** curated materials from `03_ReferenceLibrary` while learning
3. **Explore** comprehensive materials in `04_LegacyContent` when needed
4. **Document** completed work and mastery in `01_LeadArchitectKnowledgeBase`

### **Real Example: Week 1 OOP Learning**

- **02_LearningJourney**: "Week 1 daily plan + OOP exercises tracking"
- **03_ReferenceLibrary**: "Python internals guide for quick reference"
- **04_LegacyContent**: "Complete OOP tutorials and comprehensive materials"
- **01_LeadArchitectKnowledgeBase**: "Completed Week 1 OOP implementation + documentation"

**Each folder captures a different stage and type of learning activity - no redundancy!**

## 🚀 Success Tips & Common Pitfalls

### **🎯 Success Accelerators**

1. **Consistency Over Intensity**: 1 hour daily beats 7 hours once weekly
2. **Active Documentation**: Write while you learn, not after
3. **Quality References**: Curate ruthlessly, keep only what you use
4. **Portfolio Focus**: Always ask "How will I document this mastery?"
5. **Weekly Reviews**: Friday retrospectives prevent drift and confusion

### **⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

1. **Hoarding Content**: Don't put everything in Reference Library
2. **Skipping Documentation**: Active learning without capture loses value
3. **Week Planning Neglect**: Jumping in without clear objectives wastes time
4. **Portfolio Procrastination**: Don't wait until "later" to document mastery
5. **Single Folder Usage**: Use the system as designed - each folder has a purpose

## 🎪 Your Learning System in Action

### **Perfect Week Example: Week 1 OOP**

**Monday**: Plan week, set up tracking, start Day 1 Classes & Objects
**Tuesday-Thursday**: Daily 1-hour practice sessions with documentation
**Friday**: Consolidate learning into portfolio, plan Week 2
**Weekend**: Light review and preparation for Week 2 Inheritance focus

**Folder Activity**:

- `02_LearningJourney`: Active daily tracking and practice
- `03_ReferenceLibrary`: Quick Python reference lookups
- `01_LeadArchitectKnowledgeBase`: Growing portfolio of OOP mastery
- `04_LegacyContent`: Occasional deep-dive when needed

## Development

### Docs quality checks (local)

Run Markdown lint against README and all docs before opening a PR:

```powershell
# From repo root
npx --yes markdownlint-cli2 "README.md" "01_LeadArchitectKnowledgeBase/**/*.md" "02_LearningJourney/**/*.md" "03_ReferenceLibrary/**/*.md" "04_LegacyContent/**/*.md" "05_Todos/**/*.md" ".github/**/*.md"
```

This uses the repository's .markdownlint.json automatically.

### Link check (Lychee)

Run a quick local link check using Lychee (via Docker):

```powershell
# Extract links only (does not validate)
docker run --rm -w /input -v "${PWD}:/input" lycheeverse/lychee:latest --config lychee.toml --no-progress --dump README.md 01_LeadArchitectKnowledgeBase/**/*.md 02_LearningJourney/**/*.md 03_ReferenceLibrary/**/*.md 04_LegacyContent/**/*.md 05_Todos/**/*.md .github/**/*.md

# Validate links (recommended; matches CI behavior)
docker run --rm -w /input -v "${PWD}:/input" lycheeverse/lychee:latest --config lychee.toml --no-progress README.md 01_LeadArchitectKnowledgeBase/**/*.md 02_LearningJourney/**/*.md 03_ReferenceLibrary/**/*.md 04_LegacyContent/**/*.md 05_Todos/**/*.md .github/**/*.md
```

### Manual Docs Quality Workflow

CI runs automatically on PRs and pushes that modify documentation, but you can also trigger it manually:

1. Open GitHub → Actions → "Docs Quality" workflow
2. Click "Run workflow" (no inputs required)
3. View markdownlint + Lychee results; download the `lychee-report` artifact for details

Reason: Manual trigger accelerates iteration when adjusting large batches of links or performing structural renumbering.

### Deprecation & Renumbering Policy Reference

When content is renumbered (e.g., Agent modules) the old files become lightweight stubs that point to the canonical versions for 90–180 days. See the policy in `03_ReferenceLibrary/ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md` (section: "Deprecation & Renumbering Policy"). Avoid adding new links to stub files; always point to the canonical module numbers.
