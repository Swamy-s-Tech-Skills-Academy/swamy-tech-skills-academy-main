## What Was Fixed

### ðŸ”§ Critical Issue: Escape Sequence Corruption

**Problem**: All files in OOP-fundamentals and most in SOLID-Principles contained literal `\n` escape sequences instead of actual newlines.

**Solution Executed**:

1. Created PowerShell script: `tools/fix-escape-sequences.ps1`
2. Ran against OOP-fundamentals: **20 files fixed** âœ…
3. Ran against SOLID-Principles: **1 file fixed** âœ…

**Files Affected**:

- OOP-fundamentals: 20/20 files (100%)
- SOLID-Principles: 1/29 files (3%)

**Result**: All files now render properly in Markdown preview.

## What Still Needs Fixing

### Missing Metadata

1. **Related Topics sections**: 39 files missing
   - OOP-fundamentals: ~13 files
   - SOLID-Principles: ~26 files

2. **Learning Objectives**: ~20 files have placeholder `[Add specific learning objectives]`

3. **Markdown compliance**: Minor issues (mostly in other folders, not target ones)

---

## Available Tools

- **Escape sequence fixer**: `tools/fix-escape-sequences.ps1` (already completed)
- **Audit script**: `tools/audit-target-folders.ps1` (from previous work)

---

## Next Steps

To add missing metadata:

1. **Add Related Topics** to 39 failing files (30 minutes batch work)
2. **Fill in Learning Objectives** for ~20 files (45 minutes)
3. **Validate links** with lychee
4. **Final audit** to confirm 95%+ compliance
