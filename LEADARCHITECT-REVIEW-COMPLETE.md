- ✅ `analyze-leadarchitect-structure.ps1` (reusable, parameterized)
- ✅ Eliminated inline command execution
- ✅ All operations via PowerShell scripts
- ✅ 100% automation-compliant

**Tools Utilized**:
- `fix-unicode-encoding.ps1` (fixed 1 file)
- `docs-lint.ps1` (validated markdown)
- `generate-workspace-health-report.ps1` (metrics)
- `workspace-deep-dive-analysis.ps1` (initial scan)

### Quality Assurance ✅
- **Markdown Linting**: PHASE2-9_EXPANSION_ROADMAP.md passes
- **Character Encoding**: 100% UTF-8 verified
- **File Compliance**: 98.8% (80/81 files ≤175 lines)
- **Link Validation**: All internal references checked
