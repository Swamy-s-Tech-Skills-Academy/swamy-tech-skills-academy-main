## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Content Separation Policy

### **What Belongs Here (Planning & Process)**

- ✅ Course development plans and workflows
- ✅ Conference planning and event strategies
- ✅ Content intake and processing systems
- ✅ Task management and project planning
- ✅ Assessment and evaluation workflows

### **What Does NOT Belong Here (Learning Content)**

- ❌ Educational tutorials and guides
- ❌ Technical concept explanations
- ❌ Learning modules and lessons
- ❌ Reference materials and documentation
- ❌ Code examples and implementations

### **Quality Gate Question**

Before adding content here, ask: **"Is this about HOW to create/plan content, or IS it learning content itself?"**

- **HOW to create** → Belongs here (Planning)
- **IS learning content** → Belongs in `01_ReferenceLibrary/`
