# 07_LearningGround

Purpose: A safe intake area for source materials you want me to learn from and synthesize into original STSA content (zero‑copy).

Structure (use zero‑padded numbering):

- 01_Source-Materials/ — PDFs, PPTX, links.txt (raw references)
- 02_To-Process/ — items queued for capture (one subfolder per item/date)
- 03_Processed/ — archived inputs after capture is complete
- INTAKE.md — checklist of items and their target pages in `03_ReferenceLibrary`

Zero‑Copy rules (short):

- We do not reproduce slide/text verbatim. We teach the concepts in our own words and structure.
- Diagrams are ASCII‑first with Mermaid where feasible (ASCII fallback required).
- Brief quotes only if essential, with a link; otherwise, synthesize.

How to request a capture:

1. Drop the file in `01_Source-Materials/` (or add a link in `links.txt`).
2. Add an entry to `INTAKE.md` with topic, desired target folder, and any emphasis.
3. Ask me to “capture” it. I’ll create an original page in `03_ReferenceLibrary` with metadata, diagrams, examples, and cross‑links.

Notes:

- Don’t upload materials you don’t have rights to use.
- Keep filenames descriptive (YYYY‑MM‑DD_topic_author.ext).
