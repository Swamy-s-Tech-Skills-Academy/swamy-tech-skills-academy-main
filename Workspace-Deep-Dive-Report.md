#### **Key Changes**

- Removed references to `01_LeadArchitectKnowledgeBase/`
- Removed references to `02_LearningJourney/`  
- Updated `03_ReferenceLibrary/` → `01_ReferenceLibrary/`
- Added migration status awareness

### **3. Tools Scripts - UPDATED**

## 🚨 Critical Issues Identified

### **1. Content Separation Violations**

#### **Issue**: `01_ReferenceLibrary/MyAchievements/`

```text
Location: 01_ReferenceLibrary/MyAchievements/
Problem: Personal achievement tracking in learning content area
Impact: Violates pure learning content policy
```

**Resolution**: Move to `02_Planning-and-Development/achievements/` during migration

#### **Issue**: Mixed Content in Reference Library

```text
Files: 01_INDEX.md, 02_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md, 04_TAXONOMY_MAP.md
Problem: Organizational files mixed with learning content
Impact: Blurs line between content and meta-organization
```

**Resolution**: Move organizational files to planning area

### **2. Missing Target Structure**

#### **Issue**: No `02_Planning-and-Development/` folder

```text
Status: Referenced in configs but doesn't exist
Impact: Migration cannot proceed without target structure
Priority: HIGH - Create before next migration session
```

### **3. Outdated Documentation**

#### **Issue**: Main `README.md` has old structure references

```text
References: 02_LearningJourney, 03_ReferenceLibrary
Status: Needs comprehensive update
Impact: Confusing guidance for users
```

## 📋 Recommended Actions

### **Immediate (Today)**

#### **1. Create Migration Target Structure**

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "02_Planning-and-Development"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "02_Planning-and-Development/course-development" 
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "02_Planning-and-Development/conferences"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "02_Planning-and-Development/content-intake"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "02_Planning-and-Development/backlog"
```

#### **2. Clean Reference Library**

```text
Priority: Move organizational files out of learning content area
Target: 01_ReferenceLibrary/ should contain ONLY educational content
Action: Move MyAchievements/ and organizational files to planning area
```

### **Tomorrow (Migration Session)**

#### **1. Execute Phase 1 Migration**

- Follow `Daily-Migration-Tracker.md` Phase 1 plan
- Extract learning content from planning documents  
- Move planning materials to `02_Planning-and-Development/`

#### **2. Update Main README**

- Remove references to non-existent folders
- Update workflow diagrams
- Align with current structure

### **This Week**

#### **1. Complete Migration**

- Execute all migration phases
- Archive `05_Todos/` and `07_LearningGround/`
- Validate all configurations work with final structure

#### **2. Quality Assurance**
