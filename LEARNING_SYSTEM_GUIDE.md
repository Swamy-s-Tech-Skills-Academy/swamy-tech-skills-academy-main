## üöÄ Success Tips & Common Pitfalls

### **üéØ Success Accelerators**

1. **Consistency Over Intensity**: 1 hour daily beats 7 hours once weekly
2. **Active Documentation**: Write while you learn, not after
3. **Quality References**: Curate ruthlessly, keep only what you use
4. **Portfolio Focus**: Always ask "How will I document this mastery?"
5. **Weekly Reviews**: Friday retrospectives prevent drift and confusion

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

1. **Hoarding Content**: Don't put everything in Reference Library
2. **Skipping Documentation**: Active learning without capture loses value
3. **Week Planning Neglect**: Jumping in without clear objectives wastes time
4. **Portfolio Procrastination**: Don't wait until "later" to document mastery
5. **Single Folder Usage**: Use the system as designed - each folder has a purpose

---

## üé™ Your Learning System in Action

### **Perfect Week Example: Week 1 OOP**

**Monday**: Plan week, set up tracking, start Day 1 Classes & Objects
**Tuesday-Thursday**: Daily 1-hour practice sessions with documentation
**Friday**: Consolidate learning into portfolio, plan Week 2
**Weekend**: Light review and preparation for Week 2 Inheritance focus

**Folder Activity**:

- `02_LearningJourney`: Active daily tracking and practice
- `03_ReferenceLibrary`: Quick Python reference lookups
