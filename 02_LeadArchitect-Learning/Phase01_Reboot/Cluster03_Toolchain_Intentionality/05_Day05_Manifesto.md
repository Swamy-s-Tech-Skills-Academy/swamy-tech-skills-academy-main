# 03F_Day05_Manifesto

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Guardrail ledger, adoption insights, automation backlog, principles v0  
**Estimated Time**: 2 × 27-minute loops

## 🎯 Objectives for Today

- Produce Toolchain Manifesto v1.0 articulating principles, decisions, and roadmap.
- Define the rollout and enablement plan with clear ownership and timelines.
- Capture lessons learned and setup handoff for Cluster 04 systems heuristics.

## ⏱️ Loop Map

| Loop | Focus | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 09 | Manifesto drafting | Toolchain Manifesto v0.9 |
| 10 | Rollout & enablement plan | Investment & enablement roadmap + retrospective brief |

## 📝 Loop 09 – Manifesto Drafting

**Target Output**: Toolchain Manifesto v0.9 ready for stakeholder review.

### Step-by-step (Loop 09)

1. Structure the manifesto into sections: **Principles**, **Current State Summary**, **Target State**, **Investment Priorities**, **Guardrails**.
2. Integrate scorecard highlights, automation backlog top picks, and persona insights.
3. Document key decisions (invest, sustain, sunset, watchlist) with rationale.
4. Include “How we will measure success” aligned to Week 02 metrics.

### Manifesto Skeleton

```text
1. Why Intentional Tooling Matters Now
2. Principles That Guide Every Choice
3. Portfolio Snapshot & Key Findings
4. Target State Architecture
5. Investment Roadmap (Quarterly)
6. Guardrails and Compliance Commitments
7. Adoption & Enablement Expectations
8. Metrics & Feedback Cadence

## 🚀 Loop 10 – Rollout & Enablement Plan

**Target Output**: Investment & enablement roadmap plus retrospective brief.

### Step-by-step (Loop 10)

1. Plot a 3-quarter roadmap covering procurement, integration work, automation deliveries, and enablement waves.
2. Assign owners for each roadmap item and specify cross-team dependencies.
3. Outline training and communication plan (briefings, office hours, playbooks).
4. Capture Week 03 retrospective insights and Cluster 04 prerequisites (systems models needing tooling support).

### Roadmap Table

| Quarter | Initiative | Owner | Dependencies | Success Metric |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Retro Cue Card

```text
Week 03 Retrospective:
- Which tool decisions felt crisp vs. ambiguous?
- What integrations still need attention?
- Which personas need deeper enablement?
- What systems modeling assets are required next week?
```text
## ✅ Exit Criteria for Day 5

- Toolchain Manifesto v1.0 drafted and ready for executive review.
- Roadmap with owners, dependencies, and success metrics scheduled.
- Retrospective brief highlights learning and handoff items for Cluster 04.

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources

- Document templates or internal portals for manifesto publication.
- Project portfolio tools (Jira Align, ADO Roadmaps, Smartsheet).
- Communication channels (All-hands deck, Slack updates, recorded walkthroughs).

## 🔗 Handoff to Cluster 04

- Provide systems modeling requirements and tooling dependencies for the Systems Heuristics cluster.
- Schedule a cross-functional review to ensure the manifesto informs platform and architecture teams.
- Archive working docs and finalize version history for auditing purposes.
