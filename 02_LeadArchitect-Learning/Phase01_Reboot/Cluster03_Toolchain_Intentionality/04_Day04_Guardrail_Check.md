# 03E_Day04_Guardrail_Check

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Integration scorecard, automation backlog, security/compliance policies  
**Estimated Time**: 2 × 27-minute loops

## 🎯 Objectives for Today

- Validate toolchain against security, compliance, and governance standards.
- Gather adoption insights from critical stakeholders to ensure practicality.

## ⏱️ Loop Map

| Loop | Focus | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 07 | Guardrail review | Guardrail ledger |
| 08 | Stakeholder interviews | Adoption insight brief |

## 🛡️ Loop 07 – Guardrail Review

**Target Output**: Guardrail ledger listing compliance status, risks, and remediation owners.

### Step-by-step (Loop 07)

1. Cross-check key tools against security baselines (SSO, MFA, logging, data retention).
2. Verify licensing, data residency, and regulatory requirements (SOX, GDPR, HIPAA) per tool.
3. Document open risks, compensating controls, and remediation timelines.
4. Align guardrail actions with integration risk scores (focus on high-risk entries).

## 🗣️ Loop 08 – Stakeholder Interviews

**Target Output**: Adoption insight brief summarizing expectations, pain points, and enablers.

### Step-by-step (Loop 08)

1. Interview at least four personas: Architect, Product Lead, Engineering Manager, SRE.
2. Capture how each persona currently uses the toolchain, what frustrates them, and desired outcomes.
3. Identify enablement needs (training, documentation, support) and potential champions.
4. Synthesize insights into adoption themes and blockers.
