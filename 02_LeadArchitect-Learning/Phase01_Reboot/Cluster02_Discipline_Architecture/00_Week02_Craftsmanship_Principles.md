# 02A_Week02_Craftsmanship_Principles

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Week 01 outputs, team operating cadences, retrospectives from the past quarter  
**Estimated Time**: 4.5 hours (10 × 27-minute loops)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Define five craftsmanship principles that codify elite engineering behavior.
- Translate principles into measurable rituals and scorecards.
- Publish a Daily Discipline Canvas that guides personal and team execution.

## 📋 Week Structure (Ten Loops)

| Loop | Focus | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | Audit current routines and identify gaps | Routine inventory |
| 02 | Analyze high-performing teams for discipline patterns | Benchmark dossier |
| 03 | Distill five craftsmanship principles | Principle set v0 |
| 04 | Map each principle to daily/weekly rituals | Ritual mapping matrix |
| 05 | Define supporting metrics and signals | Micro-metric catalog |
| 06 | Draft Daily Discipline Canvas layout | Canvas wireframe |
| 07 | Populate canvas with commitments and safeguards | Canvas v0.9 |
| 08 | Run friction test (simulate a tough day) | Stress-test notes |
| 09 | Incorporate feedback and finalize canvas | Canvas v1.0 |
| 10 | Plan rollout and accountability loops | Adoption plan |

## 🔄 Daily Flow

| Day | Theme | Loops | Intent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Day 1 | Observe & Benchmark | 01-02 | Learn from current habits and exemplars |
| Day 2 | Principle Crafting | 03-04 | Translate insights into actionable tenets |
| Day 3 | Metrics & Canvas | 05-06 | Define proof points and structure |
| Day 4 | Stress-test | 07-08 | Check resilience under pressure |
| Day 5 | Finalize & Commit | 09-10 | Publish canvas and launch rituals |

## 🧠 Core Concepts

1. **Discipline Flywheel**: Principles → Rituals → Metrics → Feedback → Refinement.
2. **Micro-Metrics**: Small, leading indicators (code review SLA, defect escape rate) are better than lagging KPIs for daily discipline.
3. **Guardrails vs. Goals**: Principles define “must-haves,” while rituals and metrics keep you honest.

## 🛠️ Practical Implementation

- Use a quadrant layout for the Daily Discipline Canvas: *Focus*, *Delivery*, *Learning*, *Relationships*.
- Attach each ritual to an existing calendar slot to avoid creating unsustainable overhead.
- Automate metric capture where possible (Dashboards, Git analytics, observability tools).

## ✅ Success Criteria & Metrics

| Metric | Target | How to Capture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Craftsmanship principles | 5 named principles | Canvas |
| Ritual coverage | ≥ 4 domains | Calendar + Canvas |
| Metric readiness | ≥ 3 automated signals | Dashboard inventory |
| Accountability partners | ≥ 2 peers committed | Meeting notes |

## 🚧 Pitfalls

- Copying rituals from trending blogs without validating fit.
- Choosing metrics that require manual tracking (burdensome → abandoned).
- Overloading the schedule—prioritize high-leverage habits.

## 🧵 Next Steps

- Socialize the Daily Discipline Canvas with direct reports.
- Tag rituals for retrospective review (weekly/bi-weekly).
- Feed recurring friction points into Cluster 03 tooling decisions.
