**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Canvas v0.9, stress-test notes, principle stack, ritual matrix  
**Estimated Time**: 2 × 27-minute loops

## 🎯 Objectives for Today

- Finalize the Daily Discipline Canvas and package it as v1.0.
- Define the adoption plan, accountability cadence, and communication artifacts.
- Capture lessons learned and the baton pass prep for Cluster 03.

## ⏱️ Loop Map

| Loop | Focus | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 09 | Final integration | Canvas v1.0 |
| 10 | Adoption blueprint | Adoption plan + retrospective brief |

## 🧩 Loop 09 – Final Integration

**Target Output**: Canvas v1.0 ready for daily use and peer sharing.

### Step-by-step (Loop 09)

1. Apply remaining edits from stress-test backlog (copy tweaks, metric thresholds, ritual frequency).
2. Validate all metrics have owners, automation hooks, or simple update workflows.
3. Add signatures/initial boxes for accountability partners and team reviewers.
4. Export canvas to chosen format (Notion, PDF, Miro) and version-control the Markdown source.

### Quality Checklist

- [ ] Five principles clearly named and explained
- [ ] Daily/weekly/monthly rituals documented
- [ ] Metrics annotated with thresholds and tooling references
- [ ] Accountability partner section populated
- [ ] Guardrail reminders concise and actionable

## 📣 Loop 10 – Adoption Blueprint

**Target Output**: Adoption plan outlining cadence, communication, and next review checkpoint.

### Step-by-step (Loop 10)

1. Define launch audience (direct reports, partner leads, executive sponsor) and communication format.
2. Draft a 2-week rollout schedule including kick-off session, mid-point check-in, and first retrospective.
3. Specify accountability rhythms (e.g., Monday discipline huddle, Friday async scorecard review).
4. Capture lessons learned for the Week 02 retrospective and inputs required for Cluster 03 tooling decisions.
