# 02E_Day04_Stress_Test

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Canvas wireframe, metric catalog, principle stack v0  
**Estimated Time**: 2 × 27-minute loops

## 🎯 Objectives for Today

- Put the Daily Discipline Canvas through stress scenarios to confirm resilience.
- Capture adjustments required for tough days and unexpected escalations.
- Integrate peer/AI copilot feedback to refine rituals and guardrails.

## ⏱️ Loop Map

| Loop | Focus | Output |

| 07 | Stress simulation | Stress-test notes |
| 08 | Refinement sprint | Canvas v0.9 |

## ⚠️ Loop 07 – Stress Simulation

**Target Output**: Stress-test notes that document how each principle performs under pressure.

### Step-by-step (Loop 07)

1. Run two simulation scenarios: **Incident Crunch** (critical outage) and **Executive Fire Drill** (last-minute board demand).
2. For each scenario, walk through the canvas quadrants and note which rituals fail, bend, or hold.
3. Capture failure triggers, decision bottlenecks, and where metrics need faster refresh.
4. Summarize coping strategies (delegation, automation, templated comms) that kept discipline intact.

## 🔧 Loop 08 – Refinement Sprint

**Target Output**: Canvas v0.9 incorporating stress-test feedback and peer/AI suggestions.

### Step-by-step (Loop 08)

1. Prioritize changes based on severity: critical blockers first, polish last.
2. Update principle wording if stress tests expose ambiguity or loopholes.
3. Modify rituals (timebox, frequency, owner) to better absorb shocks.
4. Adjust metrics (thresholds, refresh cadence) to reflect real-world responsiveness.

### Feedback Integration Checklist

- [ ] Peer/mentor review notes actioned
- [ ] AI copilot suggestions triaged (automation, reminders, anomaly detection)
- [ ] Guardrail reminders rewritten for clarity

## ✅ Exit Criteria for Day 4

- Stress-test notes captured for at least two challenging scenarios.
- Canvas v0.9 reflects resilient rituals and calibrated metrics.
- Confidence that principles hold under pressure and do not collapse into heroics.

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources

- Incident retrospectives, PagerDuty timelines, or crisis communication playbooks.
- Collaboration tools for peer feedback (Notion, Confluence comments, shared Miro board).
- AI copilots (GitHub Copilot, Microsoft 365 Copilot) for augmentation ideas.

## 🔄 Handoff to Day 5

- Highlight remaining open risks that need sign-off or executive alignment.
- Queue follow-up conversations with accountability partners ahead of rollout.
- Prepare adoption plan outline to accelerate Loop 10 execution tomorrow.
