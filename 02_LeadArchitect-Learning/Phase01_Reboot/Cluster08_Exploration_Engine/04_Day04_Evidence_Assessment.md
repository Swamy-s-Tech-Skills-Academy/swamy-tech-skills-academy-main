# 08A_Day04_Evidence_Assessment

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Pilot runbook, instrumentation dashboards, decision rubric template  
**Estimated Time**: 54 minutes (2 × 27-minute loops)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Capture experiment evidence consistently and evaluate outcomes against predefined metrics.
- Apply a structured decision rubric to recommend scale-up, iterate, or sunset actions.

## 🔄 Loop 07 — Evidence Capture Sprint (27 minutes)

1. Collect telemetry, qualitative feedback, and cost data from active pilots.
2. Normalize evidence into a consistent format (success metrics, deviations, anomalies).
3. Annotate contextual variables (environment, participant profile, external events).
4. Summarize insights and unexpected learnings for each charter.

### Output: Evidence Log

| Charter ID | Metric | Result | Target | Interpretation | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 🔄 Loop 08 — Decision Rubric Application (27 minutes)

1. Evaluate each experiment against criteria: strategic fit, technical viability, economic value, guardrail compliance.
2. Rate confidence level (high/medium/low) based on evidence strength and repeatability.
3. Recommend action: scale, iterate, partner, sunset, or park for future review.
4. Capture decision narrative for transparency and stakeholder alignment.

### Output: Go/No-Go Rubric

| Charter ID | Strategic Fit | Viability | Value | Guardrail Compliance | Recommendation | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 🧭 Decision Hygiene

- Validate that decisions reference the guardrail charter and signal integrity constraints.
- Flag experiments needing additional data before final decision.

## ✅ Success Criteria

- Evidence captured for every active charter, linked to metrics defined on Day 2.
- Decisions documented with rationale and shared confidence level.
- Recommendations aligned with strategic portfolio balance.

## 🚧 Watch Outs

- Confirmation bias—looking only for evidence supporting initial hypothesis.
- Making scale decisions without verifying guardrail adherence and operational readiness.
