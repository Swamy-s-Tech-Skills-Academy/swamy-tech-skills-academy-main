# 08A_Day03_Experiment_Execution

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Experiment charters, guardrail charter, automation roster  
**Estimated Time**: 54 minutes (2 × 27-minute loops)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Align experiments with risk posture and guardrail expectations before launch.
- Plan execution runway, including tooling setup, staffing, and communication touchpoints.

## 🔄 Loop 05 — Risk Canvas Workshop (27 minutes)

1. For each charter, assess risks across dimensions: technical, data/privacy, regulatory, financial, reputational.
2. Map each risk to mitigation tactics and guardrail references.
3. Determine approval requirements (architecture council, security, legal, procurement).
4. Capture contingency plans for reversal or rollback if the experiment fails.

### Output: Experiment Risk Canvas

| Charter ID | Risk Dimension | Severity | Mitigation | Guardrail Reference | Approval Needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 🔄 Loop 06 — Pilot Runway Planning (27 minutes)

1. Outline pilot phases: preparation, execution, validation, close-out.
2. Assign team roles (experiment lead, data analyst, platform engineer, compliance reviewer).
3. Confirm tooling requirements (sandboxes, feature flags, telemetry pipelines).
4. Define communication cadence (stand-ups, checkpoint demos, executive updates).

### Output: Pilot Runbook Snapshot

| Charter ID | Phase | Key Activities | Owner | Tooling | Checkpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 🧭 Launch Readiness Check

- Ensure all high-severity risks have mitigation or decision-making paths.
- Validate resource availability and scheduling alignment with delivery cadences.

## ✅ Success Criteria

- Risk canvases completed and approved for each active charter.
- Pilot runbooks drafted with clear responsibilities and timelines.
- Guardrail compliance confirmed with sign-off from relevant stakeholders.

## 🚧 Watch Outs

- Launching experiments without sandbox environments or feature flags.
- Ignoring dependencies on data governance or procurement processes.
