# 08A_Day05_Exploration_Storyboard

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Evidence log, decision rubric results, experiment risk canvases  
**Estimated Time**: 54 minutes (2 × 27-minute loops)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Assemble the Exploration Storyboard capturing experiment narratives, evidence, and decisions.
- Define the exploration review cadence and integration points with portfolio governance.

## 🔄 Loop 09 — Storyboard Assembly (27 minutes)

1. Compile charter summaries, evidence highlights, and decisions into a single storyboard.
2. Visualize experiment pipeline status (ideate → charter → pilot → scale/park).
3. Highlight strategic themes, guardrail considerations, and investment recommendations.
4. Identify storytelling artifacts (slides, dashboard views, one-page briefs) for stakeholder consumption.

### Output: Exploration Storyboard v0.9

| Experiment | Current Stage | Key Evidence | Decision | Next Milestone | Sponsor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 🔄 Loop 10 — Adoption & Review Planning (27 minutes)

1. Schedule exploration review rituals (monthly council, quarterly summit, asynchronous updates).
2. Define entry/exit criteria for experiments entering or leaving the pipeline.
3. Integrate approved experiments into roadmaps, budgeting, and capability plans.
4. Capture backlog of future exploration ideas and dependencies.

### Output: Exploration Review Cadence Plan

| Ritual | Cadence | Participants | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 🧭 Handoff Pulse

- Share storyboard draft with architecture council for feedback before final publication.
- Note experiments feeding into Cluster 09 Reboot Doctrine as strategic commitments.

## ✅ Success Criteria

- Exploration Storyboard v1.0 ready for executive review.
- Review cadence defined with clear inputs/outputs and participant expectations.
- Future backlog prioritized and connected to resource planning cycles.

## 🚧 Watch Outs

- Treating storyboard as a static report instead of a living operating artifact.
- Neglecting to retire experiments that fail guardrail or value checks.
