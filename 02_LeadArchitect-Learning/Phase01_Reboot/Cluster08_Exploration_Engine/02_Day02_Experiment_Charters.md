# 08A_Day02_Experiment_Charters

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Experiment idea log, guardrail charter, signal library  
**Estimated Time**: 54 minutes (2 Ã— 27-minute loops)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Convert prioritized hypotheses into structured experiment charters.
- Define success and failure metrics aligned with signal integrity standards.

## ðŸ”„ Loop 03 â€” Charter Drafting Studio (27 minutes)

1. Select top hypotheses (mix of quick wins and strategic bets).
2. Populate charter sections: context, hypothesis, experiment design, guardrails, required resources.
3. Assign experiment sponsor, facilitator, and evaluation panel.
4. Estimate timeline and dependencies (data access, tooling, talent).

### Output: Experiment Charter v0 Template

| Charter ID | Hypothesis | Experiment Design | Guardrail Reference | Sponsors | Timeline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## ðŸ”„ Loop 04 â€” Evidence & Metrics Grid (27 minutes)

1. Define leading indicators (real-time signals) and lagging indicators (outcomes) per experiment.
2. Specify data sources, collection frequency, and acceptable error margins.
3. Align metrics with existing dashboards or plan new instrumentation work.
4. Document stop-loss conditions (when to halt the experiment).

### Output: Evidence & Metrics Grid

| Charter ID | Leading Indicator | Lagging Indicator | Data Source | Collection Cadence | Stop-Loss Condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## ðŸ§­ Charter Quality Check

- Confirm hypotheses are falsifiable and metrics measurable within the pilot duration.
- Validate guardrail references to ensure compliance boundaries are clear.

## âœ… Success Criteria

- At least three experiment charters drafted and ready for review.
- Metrics defined with explicit data sources and stop-loss triggers.
- Charter owners identified and prepared for scheduling pilot runs.

## ðŸš§ Watch Outs

- Using vanity metrics that do not prove or disprove the hypothesis.
- Charters lacking guardrail references, creating compliance risk.
