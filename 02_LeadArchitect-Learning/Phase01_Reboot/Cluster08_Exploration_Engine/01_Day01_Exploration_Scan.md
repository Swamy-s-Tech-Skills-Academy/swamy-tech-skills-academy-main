# 08A_Day01_Exploration_Scan

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Strategy themes, industry reports, innovation backlog  
**Estimated Time**: 54 minutes (2 × 27-minute loops)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Refresh the trend radar and identify emergent patterns aligned with strategic goals.
- Translate research into experimentation hypotheses with clear problem statements.

## 🔄 Loop 01 — Horizon Scanning Sprint (27 minutes)

1. Review external sources (analyst briefings, open-source roadmaps, regulatory updates, patent filings).
2. Analyze internal signals (incident retros, customer feedback, backlog friction points).
3. Cluster opportunities by theme (AI copilots, developer productivity, observability, sustainability, etc.).
4. Score each theme using impact, feasibility, and strategic fit.

### Output: Trend Radar Update

| Theme | Trigger | Opportunity | Impact | Feasibility | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 🔄 Loop 02 — Hypothesis Framing (27 minutes)

1. Craft exploration hypotheses in the form “If we experiment with X, we expect Y outcome because Z evidence.”
2. Identify target stakeholders and beneficiaries (team, customer, compliance, finance).
3. Note leading signals that would validate or falsify the hypothesis.
4. Capture quick-win vs. moonshot categorization to guide portfolio balance.

### Output: Experiment Idea Log

| Hypothesis | Beneficiary | Leading Signal | Confidence | Quick Win or Moonshot | Next Step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 🧭 Portfolio Shaping

- Ensure a mix of low-risk, incremental experiments and bold bets.
- Cross-reference with guardrail charter to exclude unsafe or non-compliant ideas.

## ✅ Success Criteria

- Minimum of eight high-quality hypotheses logged across diverse themes.
- Hypotheses mapped to strategic objectives and guardrails validated for each.
- Portfolio balance documented (at least one experiment per priority theme).

## 🚧 Watch Outs

- Chasing hype without linking to business outcomes.
- Overlooking operational constraints or guardrail implications during ideation.
