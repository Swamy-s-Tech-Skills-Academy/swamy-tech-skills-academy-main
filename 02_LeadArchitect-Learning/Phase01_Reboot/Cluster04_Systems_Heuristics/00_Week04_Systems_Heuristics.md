# 04A_Week04_Systems_Heuristics

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Toolchain Manifesto, systems maps of key products, executive priorities  
**Estimated Time**: 4.5 hours (10 × 27-minute loops)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Reconstruct critical systems thinking models tailored to your portfolio.
- Derive heuristics that simplify decision-making during complexity spikes.
- Create a Systems Heuristics Atlas capturing reusable patterns and anti-patterns.

## 📋 Week Structure (Ten Loops)

| Loop | Focus | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | Portfolio mapping | System landscape canvas |
| 02 | Feedback loop discovery | Feedback loop inventory |
| 03 | Constraint analysis | Constraint ledger |
| 04 | Heuristic drafting | Heuristic set v0 |
| 05 | Scenario simulation | Scenario playbook entries |
| 06 | Bias audit | Cognitive bias checklist |
| 07 | Peer validation | Heuristic peer review notes |
| 08 | Executive storytelling | Storyboard wireframe |
| 09 | Atlas assembly | Systems Heuristics Atlas v0.9 |
| 10 | Adoption plan | Heuristic enablement plan + retrospective brief |

## 🔄 Daily Flow

| Day | Theme | Loops | Intent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Day 1 | Map systems & feedback | 01-02 | Visualize portfolio dynamics |
| Day 2 | Pinpoint constraints & heuristics | 03-04 | Translate insights into decision shortcuts |
| Day 3 | Test scenarios & biases | 05-06 | Ensure heuristics survive stress |
| Day 4 | Validate & craft story | 07-08 | Secure buy-in and narratives |
| Day 5 | Assemble atlas | 09-10 | Publish heuristics and enable teams |

## 🧠 Core Concepts

1. **Leverage Points**: Identify the smallest changes that influence system-wide outcomes.
2. **Heuristics as Decision APIs**: Provide lightweight rules for distributed teams to act consistently.
3. **Bias Counterweights**: Pair each heuristic with signals that warn when intuition misleads.

## 🛠️ Practical Implementation

- Use causal loop diagrams to show reinforcing vs. balancing loops.
- Surface constraints using Theory of Constraints categories (resource, policy, market, people).
- Embed heuristics into existing rituals (architecture reviews, quarterly planning).

## ✅ Success Criteria & Metrics

| Metric | Target | Capture Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Critical systems mapped | ≥ 5 core systems visualized | System landscape canvas |
| Heuristics drafted | ≥ 8 actionable heuristics | Heuristic set v0 |
| Bias mitigations | ≥ 1 bias countermeasure per heuristic | Cognitive bias checklist |
| Stakeholder validation | ≥ 3 peer/executive reviews logged | Peer review notes |

## 🚧 Pitfalls

- Overcomplicating diagrams; aim for clarity over precision.
- Creating heuristics that are too generic to guide action.
- Ignoring biases, leading to heuristics that reinforce old habits.

## 🧵 Next Steps

- Integrate heuristics into architecture runbooks and review templates.
- Tie scenario playbooks to incident response and strategic planning cadences.
- Feed Atlas insights into Cluster 05 craft recovery labs for practice scenarios.
