# 04F_Day05_Atlas_Build

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Peer review notes, storyboard wireframe, heuristic set with bias mitigations  
**Estimated Time**: 2 √ó 27-minute loops

## üéØ Objectives for Today

- Assemble the Systems Heuristics Atlas v1.0 with refined heuristics, scenarios, and metrics.
- Plan adoption, enablement, and retrospective capture ahead of Cluster 05.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Loop Map

| Loop | Focus | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 09 | Atlas assembly | Systems Heuristics Atlas v0.9 |
| 10 | Enablement & retrospective | Heuristic enablement plan + retrospective brief |

## üìö Loop 09 ‚Äì Atlas Assembly

**Target Output**: Systems Heuristics Atlas v0.9 ready for publication.

### Step-by-step (Loop 09)

1. Incorporate peer feedback into heuristic definitions, signals, and bias mitigations.
2. Organize the atlas into sections: **System Overviews**, **Heuristic Cards**, **Scenario Playbooks**, **Bias & Guardrails**.
3. Ensure each heuristic card references supporting data sources and rituals.
4. Apply consistent visual cues (icons, color coding) for quick scanning.

### Atlas Section Outline

```text
1. Preface: Why systems heuristics matter now
2. Portfolio Overview & Maps
3. Heuristic Cards (8‚Äì10 entries)
4. Scenario Playbooks
5. Bias Countermeasures & Guardrails
6. Implementation Guidance & Metrics
```

## üì£ Loop 10 ‚Äì Enablement & Retrospective

**Target Output**: Heuristic enablement plan plus Week 04 retrospective brief.

### Step-by-step (Loop 10)

1. Define audiences (architecture council, platform teams, product leaders) and delivery formats (workshops, playbooks, office hours).
2. Schedule enablement sessions and assign facilitators.
3. Document success metrics (usage in reviews, incidents mitigated, decisions accelerated).
4. Capture Week 04 retrospective notes and prerequisites for Cluster 05 craft recovery labs.

### Enablement Planner

| Audience | Format | Owner | Date | Success Metric |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Retrospective Prompt

```text
Week 04 Retrospective:
- Which heuristics proved most valuable during validation?
- Where do teams need more practice applying the heuristics?
- What monitoring or tooling gaps remain?
- Which craft skills should we reinforce in Cluster 05 labs?
```

## ‚úÖ Exit Criteria for Day 5

- Systems Heuristics Atlas v1.0 packaged with consistent structure and visuals.
- Enablement plan scheduled with owners and metrics.
- Retrospective brief highlights lessons and sets up Cluster 05 objectives.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Resources

- Documentation platforms (Notion, Confluence, Git repos) for atlas publishing.
- Design tools (Figma, Canva) for heuristic card visuals.
- Meeting orchestration tools for training and enablement sessions.

## üîó Handoff to Cluster 05

- Provide craft skill gaps and practice scenarios for the Foundations Lab Journal.
- Share atlas access with engineering leads to prepare lab prompts.
- Archive decision logs and version history for future audits.
