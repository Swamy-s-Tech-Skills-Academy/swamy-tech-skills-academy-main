# 05F_Day05_Journal_Assembly

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Lab pack v0.9, pilot feedback log, telemetry checklist, rubric set  
**Estimated Time**: 2 × 27-minute loops

## 🎯 Objectives for Today

- Assemble the Foundations Lab Journal v1.0 with finalized labs, rubrics, and telemetry guidance.
- Define the adoption cadence, facilitation roster, and retrospective rituals.

## ⏱️ Loop Map

| Loop | Focus | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 09 | Journal assembly | Foundations Lab Journal v0.9 |
| 10 | Adoption cadence | Practice cadence + retrospective brief |

## 📘 Loop 09 – Journal Assembly

**Target Output**: Foundations Lab Journal v0.9 ready for publication.

### Step-by-step (Loop 09)

1. Organize journal sections: **Introduction & Outcomes**, **Lab Guides**, **Rubrics**, **Telemetry**, **Reflection Prompts**.
2. Integrate updated scripts, datasets, and checklists.
3. Embed links to automation tools, code repositories, and observability dashboards.
4. Prepare facilitator notes (time management tips, common pitfalls, coaching prompts).

### Journal Structure

```text
1. Why Craft Recovery Matters
2. Lab Overview Table
3. Detailed Lab Guides (per skill)
4. Rubrics & Telemetry Guides
5. Reflection Template & Follow-up Actions

## 🔁 Loop 10 – Adoption Cadence

**Target Output**: Practice cadence schedule and Week 05 retrospective brief.

### Step-by-step (Loop 10)

1. Define cadence (weekly labs, monthly deep dives) and participant rotation strategy.
2. Assign facilitators and create sign-up schedule.
3. Plan retrospective rhythm (after each lab cycle) and metrics (lab completion rate, skill score improvements).
4. Capture Week 05 retrospective insights and inputs for Cluster 06 signal tracking.

### Adoption Plan Table

| Cadence | Audience | Facilitator | Metric | Start Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Retrospective Prompt

```text
Week 05 Retrospective:
- Which labs created breakthrough moments?
- Where did telemetry underperform or overload participants?
- Which skills still show lagging proficiency?
- What signals should Cluster 06 track to prove craft improvements?
```text
## ✅ Exit Criteria for Day 5

- Foundations Lab Journal v1.0 compiled with consistent formatting and links.
- Practice cadence scheduled with facilitators and metrics.
- Retrospective brief signaling handoff requirements for signal intelligence.

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources

- Knowledge base or documentation platform for journal hosting.
- Scheduling tools (Calendly, Teams Shifts, Google Calendar).
- Analytics dashboards to track skill improvement.

## 🔗 Handoff to Cluster 06

- Share lab results and telemetry feeds with the Signal Intelligence cluster for ongoing measurement.
- Provide feedback loops to integrate lab outcomes into tooling decisions.
- Communicate success stories to sustain momentum.
