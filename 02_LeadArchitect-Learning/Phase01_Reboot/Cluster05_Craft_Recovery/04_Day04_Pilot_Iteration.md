# 05E_Day04_Pilot_Iteration

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Rubrics, telemetry checklist, pilot participant list  
**Estimated Time**: 2 × 27-minute loops

## 🎯 Objectives for Today

- Conduct a pilot run-through of the micro-labs with representative participants.
- Iterate on lab design based on telemetry, rubric scoring, and participant feedback.

## ⏱️ Loop Map

| Loop | Focus | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 07 | Pilot execution | Pilot feedback log |
| 08 | Iteration sprint | Lab pack v0.9 |

## 🧪 Loop 07 – Pilot Execution

**Target Output**: Pilot feedback log with qualitative and quantitative observations.

### Step-by-step (Loop 07)

1. Run at least one lab with a small group (3–5 participants across roles).
2. Capture telemetry data in real-time and record rubric scores.
3. Facilitate debrief capturing what challenged participants, where they excelled, and tool issues.
4. Tag feedback under **Content**, **Tooling**, **Timing**, **Support**.

## 🔧 Loop 08 – Iteration Sprint

**Target Output**: Lab pack v0.9 incorporating pilot adjustments.

### Step-by-step (Loop 08)

1. Prioritize feedback into **Must Fix**, **Should Fix**, **Nice to Have**.
2. Update scripts, datasets, and instructions to resolve critical issues.
3. Adjust rubrics or telemetry triggers based on pilot findings.
4. Prepare comms outlining changes and next steps for broader rollout.
