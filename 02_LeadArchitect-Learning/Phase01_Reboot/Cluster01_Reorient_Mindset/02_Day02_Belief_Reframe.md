# Day 2 – Belief Reframe (Loops 03-04)

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Day 1 outputs (belief ledger, evidence packets), Week 01 plan  
**Estimated Time**: 54 minutes (2 × 27-minute loops)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Convert the three highest-urgency legacy beliefs into future-fit convictions tied to enterprise direction.
- Stress-test each replacement belief against a live strategic initiative to surface contradictions early.

## 🧭 Session Agenda

| Segment | Duration | Activity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Framing | 5 min | Review Day 1 highlights and select top beliefs to rework |
| Loop 03 | 27 min | Draft three replacement beliefs with measurable intent |
| Break | 2 min | Walk/stretch to reset focus |
| Loop 04 | 27 min | Scenario collision test with flagship initiative |
| Wrap | 5 min | Capture deltas, open questions, and stakeholder touchpoints |

## 🛠️ Loop 03 Template – Replacement Belief Canvas

| Legacy Belief | Replacement Belief | Intent Signal | Metric or Guardrail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| e.g., "Velocity beats cohesion" | "Velocity requires disciplined cohesion" | Weekly architecture council | Team dependency score ≤ 2 |

### Drafting Prompts

1. **Who benefits?** Tie the replacement to a specific audience (customers, delivery teams, exec sponsors).
2. **What evidence makes it true now?** Cite data or shifts uncovered on Day 1.
3. **How will we know it sticks?** Attach one observable metric or ritual.
4. **Where can it break?** List two plausible failure modes to test in Loop 04.

## 🔍 Loop 04 – Scenario Collision Test

Use a current initiative (transformation program, product relaunch, platform modernization) and run each belief through this ladder:

```text
[Belief Statement]
   ↓ apply to
[Initiative Objective]
   ↓ ask
- What decision changes immediately?
- Who needs persuasion or retraining?
- Which dependencies become fragile?
- What leading indicator signals drift?
```text
Record contradictions or gaps in an *Impact Ledger*:

| Belief | Decision Impact | Stakeholder Impact | Risk & Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## ⚠️ Watch-outs

- **Vague phrasing** drains power. Anchor statements with verbs and directional targets (increase, limit, preserve).
- **Initiative mismatch**: choose a program with executive visibility; low-stakes pilots hide friction.
- **Metric inflation**: select one clear signal per belief to keep adoption trackable.

## 🔄 Handoff to Day 3

- Finalize three replacement beliefs with impact notes.
- Draft a short summary (≤150 words) to brief stakeholders before Loop 05 interviews.
- Flag one belief that still feels fragile and note questions for Day 3 commitment work.
