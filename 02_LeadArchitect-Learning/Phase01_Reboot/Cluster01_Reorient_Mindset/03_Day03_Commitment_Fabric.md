# Day 3 – Commitment Fabric (Loops 05-06)

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Day 2 replacement beliefs, stakeholder summary draft  
**Estimated Time**: 54 minutes (2 × 27-minute loops)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Translate the replacement belief stack into tangible commitments, rituals, and support systems.
- Capture stakeholder friction points and emotional signals to inform targeted coaching.

## 🧭 Session Agenda

| Segment | Duration | Activity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Opening pulse | 5 min | Rehearse the three updated beliefs aloud; note tension or hesitation |
| Loop 05 | 27 min | Stakeholder empathy mapping and friction catalog |
| Break | 2 min | Hydrate, reflect |
| Loop 06 | 27 min | Draft the Perspective Reset Letter full narrative |
| Wrap | 5 min | Confirm next touchpoints and data needed for Day 4 calibration |

## 🧠 Loop 05 – Empathy & Resistance Map

Use the *Commitment Web* template to surface where support or resistance will emerge.

| Stakeholder | Desired Outcome | Anticipated Resistance | Emotional Signal | Support Move |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| e.g., Product VP | Faster roadmap bets | Fears reduced autonomy | Arms crossed, short replies | Co-design experiment backlog |

Reflection prompts:

1. Which belief threatens a stakeholder’s KPI or identity?
2. What rituals or artifacts will build trust (e.g., weekly update, metrics dashboard)?
3. Which ally can amplify the new mindset publicly?

## 📝 Loop 06 – Perspective Reset Letter Draft

Structure the letter using the **ARC** narrative pattern:

```text
Act 1 – Acknowledge the past (legacy belief, results, gratitude)
Act 2 – Reveal catalyst (evidence gathered, strategic urgency)
Act 3 – Commit forward (new beliefs, rituals, metrics, invitation)
```

Checklist for the draft:

- ✅ Open with a specific moment that illustrates the old belief in action.
- ✅ Reference at least two data points or quotes captured in Day 1 and Day 2.
- ✅ Spell out the new commitments as bullet statements with owners and cadences.
- ✅ Close with a clear request for feedback or partnership.

## ⚠️ Watch-outs

- **Generic tone** loses credibility. Write as if addressing named leaders, not “the organization.”
- **Commitment overload** creates skepticism. Limit to 3–4 visible rituals for launch.
- **Emotional blind spots**: log your own discomfort; it informs coaching moves on Day 4.

## 🔄 Handoff to Day 4

- Save the letter draft plus a 60-second spoken pitch recording.
- Highlight two sections that need validation (metrics, rituals, or tone) for feedback loops tomorrow.
- Schedule short syncs with key allies identified in the Commitment Web.
