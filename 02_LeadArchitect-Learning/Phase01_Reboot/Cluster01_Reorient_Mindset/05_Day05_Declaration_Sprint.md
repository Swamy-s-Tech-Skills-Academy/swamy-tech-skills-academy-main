# Day 5 – Declaration Sprint (Loops 09-10)

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Updated Perspective Reset Letter v0.9, adoption flywheel, Day 4 feedback decisions  
**Estimated Time**: 54 minutes (2 × 27-minute loops)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Finalize the Perspective Reset Letter and supporting artifacts for organization-wide sharing.
- Define launch choreography, success metrics, and follow-through checkpoints for the reboot doctrine.

## 🧭 Session Agenda

| Segment | Duration | Activity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Opening intent | 5 min | Re-center on why the reboot matters now; visualize desired reactions |
| Loop 09 | 27 min | Finalize assets (letter, ritual calendar, dashboard extract) |
| Break | 2 min | Hydrate, breathing reset |
| Loop 10 | 27 min | Run-of-show design, risk rehearsal, and next-cluster bridge |
| Wrap | 5 min | Confirm commitments and send launch invites |

## 📝 Loop 09 – Asset Finalization Checklist

- ✅ Perspective Reset Letter v1.0 (PDF + shareable doc link) with tracked decisions.
- ✅ Ritual Calendar (4-week view) noting owners, cadences, and channels.
- ✅ Metric Dashboard snapshot or draft query (cycle time, decision latency, ritual attendance).
- ✅ FAQ appendix addressing top three concerns surfaced during Day 3 empathy mapping.

Quality bar prompts:

1. Does the opening paragraph restate the stakes using current executive language?
2. Are commitments stated as **"I will"** or **"We will"** with measurable outcomes?
3. Is there an explicit call for feedback, including timeline and channel?
4. Can each artifact live independently (e.g., rituals board posted in collaboration suite)?

## 🎬 Loop 10 – Launch Run-of-Show

Design distribution and reinforcement in three acts:

```text
Act A – Launch Event
  - Audience: Exec staff + architecture council (live session)
  - Channel: 30-minute town hall or strategic stand-up slot
  - Success Metric: ≥90% attendance, 3 live questions answered

Act B – Team Cascade
  - Audience: Delivery leads and product heads
  - Channel: Toolkit drop + 20-minute micro-workshop
  - Success Metric: Self-assessment survey response rate ≥80%

Act C – Sustain & Measure
  - Audience: Broader organization
  - Channel: Weekly ritual updates + dashboard broadcast
  - Success Metric: Ritual adherence ≥75% after four weeks
```

### Risk Rehearsal Matrix

| Risk | Trigger | Countermeasure | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low engagement | Calendar conflicts | Send async recap + office hours | Chief of Staff |
| Metric dispute | Data accuracy challenged | Prep methodology appendix | Data Ops Lead |
| Ritual drift | Owners miss two consecutive cadences | Deploy reminder automation | PMO |

## ⚠️ Watch-outs

- **Overstuffed launch** dilutes focus. Keep artifacts tight and reinforce during Cascade/Sustain phases.
- **Metric opacity**: publish the data source, refresh cadence, and escalation path to build trust.
- **No next step**: end every communication with the next checkpoint to maintain momentum.

## 🔄 Next-Cluster Bridge

- Log lessons learned, open risks, and dependency notes in the Handoff Brief for Cluster 02.
- Share artifacts with the Craft Recovery lead to influence professionalism rituals.
- Schedule a 30-day retrospective to evaluate belief adoption and recalibrate metrics.
