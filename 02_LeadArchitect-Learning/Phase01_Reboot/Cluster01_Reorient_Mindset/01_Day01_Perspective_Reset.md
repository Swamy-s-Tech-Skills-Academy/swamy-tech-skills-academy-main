**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Week 01 plan, leadership retrospectives, current mission statement  
**Estimated Time**: 54 minutes (2 × 27-minute loops)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Name legacy beliefs that no longer support the mission.
- Collect evidence from stakeholders, delivery data, and industry signals that invalidate those beliefs.

## 🧭 Session Agenda

| Segment | Duration | Activity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Welcome & framing | 5 min | Revisit why Phase 01 focuses on mindset |
| Loop 01 | 27 min | Belief inventory: capture “old truths” and impacts |
| Break | 2 min | Reset focus; hydrate |
| Loop 02 | 27 min | Evidence scan: gather proofs contradicting each belief |
| Wrap | 5 min | Summarize findings and plan for Loop 03 |

## 📝 Loop 01 Checklist

- List at least five legacy beliefs impacting architecture, delivery, or leadership.
- For each, document the origin story (project, leader, era).
- Record current negative consequences (e.g., slow decisions, blocked innovation).
- Rate urgency (High/Medium/Low) to prioritize future work.

## 🔍 Loop 02 Evidence Sources

- Portfolio dashboards: cycle time, defect escape rate, customer NPS.
- Executive OKR updates and board narratives.
- Market research on competitor releases or platform shifts.
- Team sentiment surveys or exit interviews.

## 📌 Output Templates

```text

  - 2025 platform reliability review favors modular monolith for core services
  - Ops toil hours +18% YoY running microservice mesh
  - Customer complaints about latency in cross-service flows
Urgency: High
```

## ⚠️ Watch-outs

- Avoid turning the session into blame—focus on systems, not individuals.
- Resist the urge to jump ahead into solutions; the goal is clarity.
- Capture emotions or tension while fresh; they inform the narrative later.

## 🔄 Handoff to Day 2

- Highlight top three beliefs to reframe in Loop 03.
- Summarize the most compelling data points (links, screenshots, stats).
- Block calendar time for stakeholder interviews before Loop 05.
