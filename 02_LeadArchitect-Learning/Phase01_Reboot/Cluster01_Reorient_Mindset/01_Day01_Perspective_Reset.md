## 📝 Loop 01 Checklist

- List at least five legacy beliefs impacting architecture, delivery, or leadership.
- For each, document the origin story (project, leader, era).
- Record current negative consequences (e.g., slow decisions, blocked innovation).
- Rate urgency (High/Medium/Low) to prioritize future work.

## ⚠️ Watch-outs

- Avoid turning the session into blame—focus on systems, not individuals.
- Resist the urge to jump ahead into solutions; the goal is clarity.
- Capture emotions or tension while fresh; they inform the narrative later.

## 🔄 Handoff to Day 2

- Highlight top three beliefs to reframe in Loop 03.
- Summarize the most compelling data points (links, screenshots, stats).
- Block calendar time for stakeholder interviews before Loop 05.
