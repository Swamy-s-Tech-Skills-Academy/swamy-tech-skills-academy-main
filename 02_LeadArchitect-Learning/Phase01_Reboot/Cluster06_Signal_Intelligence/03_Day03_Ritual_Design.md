# 06D_Day03_Ritual_Design

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Insight cards, metric integrity ledger, existing reporting cadence  
**Estimated Time**: 2 × 27-minute loops

## 🎯 Objectives for Today

- Define analytics rituals that ensure signals are reviewed and acted upon.
- Draft dashboard storyboards that deliver narrative-driven insights.

## ⏱️ Loop Map

| Loop | Focus | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 05 | Ritual design | Analytics cadence map |
| 06 | Visualization storyboard | Dashboard storyboard |

## 🔄 Loop 05 – Ritual Design

**Target Output**: Analytics cadence map mapping signals to review rhythms and owners.

### Step-by-step (Loop 05)

1. Align signals to leadership and team cadences (daily stand-ups, weekly ops review, monthly strategy sync).
2. For each ritual, define purpose, indicators reviewed, decision thresholds, and follow-up actions.
3. Assign facilitators and note required tooling (dashboards, alerts, meeting templates).
4. Ensure rituals reinforce Week 02 discipline and Week 05 craft improvements.

## 📊 Loop 06 – Visualization Storyboard

**Target Output**: Dashboard storyboard showing layout, narrative flow, and interaction patterns.

### Step-by-step (Loop 06)

1. Outline dashboard pages: **Executive Overview**, **Engineering Health**, **Craft Mastery**, **Customer Impact**.
2. Map each page to the insight cards: highlight trend, context, action box.
3. Define visual components (sparklines, bullet charts, anomaly banners) and data refresh cadence.
4. Specify filters and drill-down paths for deeper investigation.
