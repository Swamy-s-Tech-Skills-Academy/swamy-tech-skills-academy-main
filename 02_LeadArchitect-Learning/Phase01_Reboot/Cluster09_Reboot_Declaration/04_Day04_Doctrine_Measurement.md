# 09A_Day04_Doctrine_Measurement

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Launch plan, guardrail charter metrics, exploration storyboard  
**Estimated Time**: 54 minutes (2 × 27-minute loops)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Define measurement framework to track doctrine adoption and outcomes.
- Prepare objection handling playbook ensuring sustained commitment.

## 🔄 Loop 07 — Adoption Scorecard Design (27 minutes)

1. Identify leading indicators (ritual adoption, guardrail compliance, experiment throughput).
2. Define lagging indicators (business impact, quality improvements, stakeholder sentiment).
3. Map each metric to data sources, owners, and review cadence.
4. Establish threshold triggers prompting coaching or intervention.

### Output: Reboot Adoption Scorecard

| Metric | Type | Target | Data Source | Review Cadence | Owner | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 🔄 Loop 08 — Objection & Risk Playbook (27 minutes)

1. List potential objections (capacity concerns, skepticism, conflicting priorities, change fatigue).
2. Draft responses grounding in evidence, benefits, and support mechanisms.
3. Assign escalation contacts for unresolved resistance.
4. Capture follow-up actions to reinforce commitment (coaching sessions, success stories).

### Output: Objection Handling Playbook

| Objection | Root Cause | Response Strategy | Supporting Evidence | Escalation Path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 🧭 Sustainability Pulse

- Ensure metrics align with existing dashboards to avoid reporting fatigue.
- Embed scorecard review into leadership rituals (weekly architecture huddles, monthly governance boards).

## ✅ Success Criteria

- Adoption scorecard drafted with clear owners and cadence.
- Objection playbook ready for training facilitators and sponsors.
- Threshold triggers linked to coaching and escalation plans.

## 🚧 Watch Outs

- Selecting metrics that teams cannot influence directly.
- Underestimating culture-related objections and emotional responses.
