# 07A_Day02_Guardrail_Definition

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Guardrail inventory snapshot, risk register  
**Estimated Time**: 54 minutes (2 × 27-minute loops)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Draft concise, outcome-oriented guardrail statements.
- Link each guardrail to leading and lagging signals for monitoring.
- Prioritize guardrails based on risk impact and delivery friction.

## 🔄 Loop 03 — Guardrail Drafting Clinic (27 minutes)

1. Define the guardrail structure: trigger, expectation, enforcement, exception policy.
2. Convert high-priority gaps from Day 1 into draft guardrail statements.
3. Map guardrails to the engineering lifecycle stage (ideation, build, release, operate).
4. Tag each guardrail with risk category (security, reliability, ethics, financial, reputation).

### Output: Guardrail Definition Worksheet

| Guardrail | Lifecycle Stage | Risk Category | Trigger | Expected Behavior | Exception Path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 🔄 Loop 04 — Signal & Drift Mapping (27 minutes)

1. For each guardrail, identify at least one leading signal and one lagging signal.
2. Specify signal sources (dashboards, alerts, reviews, manual checklists).
3. Flag signals that do not exist yet; log them as instrumentation backlog items.
4. Estimate drift tolerance (how long before a breach requires escalation).

### Output: Guardrail-to-Signal Matrix

| Guardrail | Leading Signal | Lagging Signal | Signal Source | Drift Tolerance | Instrumentation Gap? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 🧭 Prioritization Pulse

- Score each guardrail by impact × urgency to set drafting order.
- Highlight any guardrails needing executive sponsorship.

## ✅ Success Criteria

- Minimum of 12 guardrail drafts covering all critical risk categories.
- Every guardrail linked to measurable signals with ownership assigned.
- Clear list of missing instrumentation tasks for follow-up with analytics teams.

## 🚧 Watch Outs

- Writing guardrails as vague principles instead of enforceable rules.
- Linking guardrails to signals that teams cannot access or influence.
