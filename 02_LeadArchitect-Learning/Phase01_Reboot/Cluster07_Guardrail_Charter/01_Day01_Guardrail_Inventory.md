# 07A_Day01_Guardrail_Inventory

**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Signal library, policy repository access  
**Estimated Time**: 54 minutes (2 × 27-minute loops)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Catalog current guardrails, policies, and controls across delivery.
- Assess alignment with signals and rituals from prior clusters.
- Identify immediate gaps requiring guardrail creation.

## 🔄 Loop 01 — Policy Landscape Mapping (27 minutes)

1. Compile existing guardrails (security, quality, compliance, release gates).
2. Classify by domain (code, data, infrastructure, product, governance).
3. Identify associated signals and enforcement mechanisms (manual, automated, verbal).
4. Document ownership and cadence (who manages, review frequency).

### Output: Guardrail Inventory Table

| Guardrail | Domain | Enforcement | Owner | Signal Link | Review Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 🔄 Loop 02 — Risk & Gap Snapshot (27 minutes)

1. Analyze where guardrails are missing, outdated, or rely on manual enforcement.
2. Map each guardrail to the corresponding signal from the signal library.
3. Create a quick risk register: severity, likelihood, impacted guardrail.
4. Capture cultural and delivery friction points (where guardrails slow down or block teams).

### Output: Risk Register (snapshot)

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Guardrail | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 🧭 Ritual Integration Check

- Confirm inventory is reflected in weekly or monthly rituals.
- Note where new rituals are required to maintain the guardrails.

## ✅ Success Criteria

- Comprehensive guardrail inventory captured and validated.
- Risks prioritized with clear guardrail linkage.
- Ownership and cadence documented.

## 🚧 Watch Outs

- Overlooking informal guardrails enforced via culture or tribal knowledge.
- Documenting guardrails without clear owners or review cycles.
