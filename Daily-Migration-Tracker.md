- **Course Development**: Keep planning separate from learning content
- **Intake System**: Dedicated workflow folder outside Reference Library

### **Updated Migration Targets**

| Content Type | Current Location | **NEW Target** | Reason |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| **Learning Guides** | `Design-Principles-Complete-Guide.md` | `01_ReferenceLibrary/01_Development/02_software-design-principles/` | ‚úÖ Pure learning content |
| **Conference Planning** | `AI-Agent-Conference-Plan.md` | `02_Planning-and-Development/conferences/` | ‚ùå Planning, not learning |
| **Course Development** | `OOP_DP.md`, `SOLID-Video-Courses.md` | `02_Planning-and-Development/course-dev/` | ‚ùå Planning, not learning |
| **Intake System** | `07_LearningGround/` | `02_Planning-and-Development/content-intake/` | ‚ùå Process, not learning |
| **Active Backlog** | `Backlog.md` | `02_Planning-and-Development/backlog/` | ‚ùå Planning, not learning |
