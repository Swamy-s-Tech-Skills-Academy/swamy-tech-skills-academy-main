# üìÖ Daily Migration Tracker: Todos & LearningGround

**Migration Start Date**: September 4, 2025  
**Approach**: Daily incremental migration  
**Status**: Phase planning complete

---

## ‚úÖ Today's Completion (September 4, 2025)

- [x] **Analysis Complete**: Evaluated both `05_Todos/` and `07_LearningGround/` folders
- [x] **Migration Plan Created**: Comprehensive 4-phase plan documented
- [x] **Decision Made**: Daily incremental approach selected
- [x] **Repository Assessment**: Current structure and content analyzed

**Key Findings**:

- `05_Todos/`: 10 files including high-value conference plans and course development
- `07_LearningGround/`: Active intake system with processing pipeline
- **High Priority**: AI Agent Conference Plan, Design Principles Guide, Course Development materials
- **System Integration Needed**: Unified backlog and intake workflow

---

## üéØ **REVISED Strategy**: Learning Content Only in Reference Library

### **New Approach**: Pure Learning Content Focus

- **01_ReferenceLibrary**: **ONLY** educational content, tutorials, guides, concepts
- **Planning Materials**: Move to separate dedicated planning folder
- **Course Development**: Keep planning separate from learning content
- **Intake System**: Dedicated workflow folder outside Reference Library

### **Updated Migration Targets**

| Content Type | Current Location | **NEW Target** | Reason |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| **Learning Guides** | `Design-Principles-Complete-Guide.md` | `01_ReferenceLibrary/01_Development/02_software-design-principles/` | ‚úÖ Pure learning content |
| **Conference Planning** | `AI-Agent-Conference-Plan.md` | `02_Planning-and-Development/conferences/` | ‚ùå Planning, not learning |
| **Course Development** | `OOP_DP.md`, `SOLID-Video-Courses.md` | `02_Planning-and-Development/course-dev/` | ‚ùå Planning, not learning |
| **Intake System** | `07_LearningGround/` | `02_Planning-and-Development/content-intake/` | ‚ùå Process, not learning |
| **Active Backlog** | `Backlog.md` | `02_Planning-and-Development/backlog/` | ‚ùå Planning, not learning |

## üéØ Tomorrow's Plan (September 5, 2025) - **REVISED**

### **Phase 1: Learning Content Extraction** ‚è±Ô∏è 60 minutes

#### **Priority 1: Extract Pure Learning Content**

- [ ] Review `Design-Principles-Complete-Guide.md` ‚Üí Extract learning sections for Reference Library
- [ ] Review `AI-Agent-Conference-Plan.md` ‚Üí Extract educational framework for Reference Library  
- [ ] Review `OOP_DP.md` ‚Üí Extract learning concepts for Reference Library
- [ ] **Focus**: Only migrate educational/tutorial content, not planning aspects

#### **Priority 2: Create Planning Structure Outside Reference Library**

- [ ] Create `02_Planning-and-Development/` folder structure (separate from Reference Library)
- [ ] Move all planning materials to dedicated planning folder
- [ ] Keep `01_ReferenceLibrary/` purely for learning content

#### **Setup Tasks**

- [ ] Create `02_Planning-and-Development/` folder structure
- [ ] Extract learning content from planning documents  
- [ ] Maintain clear separation: Learning vs Planning

## üìã Future Daily Sessions

### **Day 3 (September 6, 2025)**: Planning System Setup

- [ ] Complete `02_Planning-and-Development/` folder organization
- [ ] Move all planning materials to dedicated planning structure
- [ ] Establish intake workflow outside Reference Library

### **Day 4 (September 7, 2025)**: Content Refinement  

- [ ] Review extracted learning content for quality
- [ ] Add STSA metadata to learning materials
- [ ] Cross-reference between learning topics

### **Day 5 (September 8, 2025)**: Final Organization

- [ ] Archive original `05_Todos/` and `07_LearningGround/` folders
- [ ] Update main repository README with clear structure
- [ ] Document separation: Learning (Reference Library) vs Planning (Planning folder)

## üöÄ Quick Start for Tomorrow

### **When Ready to Continue**

1. **Focus**: Extract **only learning content** from planning documents
2. **Create**: `02_Planning-and-Development/` for all planning materials  
3. **Maintain**: Pure learning focus in `01_ReferenceLibrary/`
4. **Estimated time**: ~60 minutes for content extraction

### **Key Files to Review Tomorrow**

- `05_Todos/Design-Principles-Complete-Guide.md` ‚Üí **Extract learning sections only**
- `05_Todos/07092025_AI-Agent-Conference-Plan.md` ‚Üí **Extract educational framework only**  
- `05_Todos/07092025_OOP_DP.md` ‚Üí **Extract learning concepts only**
- `07_LearningGround/` ‚Üí **Move entire intake system to planning folder**
