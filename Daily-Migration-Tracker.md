## ✅ Yesterday's Completion (September 4, 2025)

- [x] **Analysis Complete**: Evaluated both `05_Todos/` and `07_LearningGround/` folders
- [x] **Migration Plan Created**: Comprehensive 4-phase plan documented
- [x] **Decision Made**: Daily incremental approach selected
- [x] **Repository Assessment**: Current structure and content analyzed

**Key Findings**:

- `05_Todos/`: 10 files including high-value conference plans and course development
- `07_LearningGround/`: Active intake system with processing pipeline
- **High Priority**: AI Agent Conference Plan, Design Principles Guide, Course Development materials
- **System Integration Needed**: Unified backlog and intake workflow

## 🎯 **REVISED Strategy**: Learning Content Only in Reference Library

### **New Approach**: Pure Learning Content Focus

- **01_ReferenceLibrary**: **ONLY** educational content, tutorials, guides, concepts
- **Planning Materials**: Move to separate dedicated planning folder
- **Course Development**: Keep planning separate from learning content
- **Intake System**: Dedicated workflow folder outside Reference Library

### **Updated Migration Targets**

| Content Type | Current Location | **NEW Target** | Reason |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| **Learning Guides** | `Design-Principles-Complete-Guide.md` | `01_ReferenceLibrary/01_Development/02_software-design-principles/` | ✅ Pure learning content |
| **Conference Planning** | `AI-Agent-Conference-Plan.md` | `02_Planning-and-Development/conferences/` | ❌ Planning, not learning |
| **Course Development** | `OOP_DP.md`, `SOLID-Video-Courses.md` | `02_Planning-and-Development/course-dev/` | ❌ Planning, not learning |
| **Intake System** | `07_LearningGround/` | `02_Planning-and-Development/content-intake/` | ❌ Process, not learning |
| **Active Backlog** | `Backlog.md` | `02_Planning-and-Development/backlog/` | ❌ Planning, not learning |

## 🎯 Tomorrow's Plan (September 5, 2025) - **REVISED**

### **Phase 1: Learning Content Extraction** ⏱️ 60 minutes

#### **Priority 1: Extract Pure Learning Content**

- [ ] Review `Design-Principles-Complete-Guide.md` → Extract learning sections for Reference Library
- [ ] Review `AI-Agent-Conference-Plan.md` → Extract educational framework for Reference Library  
- [ ] Review `OOP_DP.md` → Extract learning concepts for Reference Library
- [ ] **Focus**: Only migrate educational/tutorial content, not planning aspects

#### **Priority 2: Create Planning Structure Outside Reference Library**

- [ ] Create `02_Planning-and-Development/` folder structure (separate from Reference Library)
- [ ] Move all planning materials to dedicated planning folder
- [ ] Keep `01_ReferenceLibrary/` purely for learning content

#### **Setup Tasks**

- [ ] Create `02_Planning-and-Development/` folder structure
