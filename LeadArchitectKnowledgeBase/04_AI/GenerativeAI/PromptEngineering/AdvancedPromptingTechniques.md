# üöÄ Advanced Prompting Techniques

## üéØ Overview

Advanced prompting techniques that go beyond basic prompting to achieve sophisticated AI interactions, complex reasoning, and specialized outputs.

---

## üß† Chain-of-Thought Prompting

### **Definition**

Explicitly guide the model through step-by-step reasoning to improve accuracy on complex problems.

### **When to Use**

- Mathematical problems
- Logical reasoning tasks
- Multi-step analysis
- Complex decision making

### **Example**

```text
Question: A store has 20 apples. They sell 8 in the morning and 5 in the afternoon. How many apples are left?

Let me think step by step:
1. Start with 20 apples
2. Sell 8 in morning: 20 - 8 = 12 apples left
3. Sell 5 in afternoon: 12 - 5 = 7 apples left
Therefore, 7 apples remain.
```

### **Best Practices**

- Use phrases like "Let me think step by step"
- Break complex problems into smaller parts
- Show the reasoning process explicitly
- Validate each step before proceeding

## üé≠ Role-Based Prompting

### **Definition**

Assign the AI a specific role or persona to influence its response style and expertise.

### **Effective Roles**

- **Expert Consultant**: "As a senior data scientist..."
- **Teacher**: "Explain this as if teaching a beginner..."
- **Analyst**: "From a business analysis perspective..."
- **Critic**: "Critically evaluate this approach..."

### **Example**

```text
You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in distributed systems.
Review this microservices design and provide architectural recommendations:

[Design details here]

Focus on:
- Scalability concerns
- Security implications
- Performance bottlenecks
- Best practices violations
```

### **Implementation Tips**

- Be specific about expertise level
- Define the perspective you want
- Set clear expectations for output style
- Include relevant domain knowledge

---

## üîó Prompt Chaining

### **Definition**

Break complex tasks into multiple sequential prompts, using outputs from previous steps as inputs for subsequent ones.

### **Use Cases**

- Multi-stage content creation
- Complex analysis workflows
- Data processing pipelines
- Quality assurance processes

### **Example Workflow**

```text
Step 1: Extract key themes
"Analyze this customer feedback and extract the main themes: [feedback]"

Step 2: Prioritize themes
"Given these themes: [output from step 1], rank them by business impact"

Step 3: Create action plan
"For the top 3 themes: [output from step 2], create specific action items"
```

### **Best Practices**

- Plan the entire workflow before starting
- Maintain context between steps
- Validate outputs at each stage
- Handle errors gracefully

---

## üéØ Template-Based Prompting

### **Definition**

Use structured templates to ensure consistency and completeness in responses.

### **Template Example**

````text
Task: Code Review
Code: [CODE_BLOCK]

Please review using this format:

**Overall Quality**: [Rating 1-10]
**Strengths**:
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]

**Issues Found**:
- [Issue 1]: [Severity] - [Description]
- [Issue 2]: [Severity] - [Description]

**Recommendations**:
1. [Actionable suggestion 1]
2. [Actionable suggestion 2]

**Refactored Code**:
```[language]

## üîÑ Iterative Refinement

### **Definition**
Progressively improve outputs through multiple rounds of feedback and refinement.

### **Process**
1. **Initial Prompt**: Get baseline output
2. **Analyze**: Identify gaps or issues
3. **Refine**: Provide specific feedback
4. **Iterate**: Repeat until satisfactory

### **Example**
```text
Round 1: "Write a product description for a wireless headphone"

Round 2: "Make it more technical and include battery life, frequency response, and connectivity features"

Round 3: "Add a comparison with competitors and emphasize unique selling points"
````

## üìä Constraint-Based Prompting

### **Definition**

Explicitly define constraints, limitations, and requirements to guide output format and content.

### **Types of Constraints**

- **Length**: "In exactly 100 words..."
- **Format**: "Respond in JSON format..."
- **Style**: "Use professional, formal tone..."
- **Content**: "Focus only on technical aspects..."
- **Audience**: "Explain for non-technical stakeholders..."

### **Example**

```text
Create a project status report with these constraints:
- Maximum 200 words
- Include only facts, no opinions
- Use bullet points for key updates
- Include risk level (Low/Medium/High)
- Target audience: Executive leadership
- Format: Email body text
```

## üé™ Multi-Modal Prompting

### **Definition**

Combine text with other modalities (images, audio, code) for richer interactions.

### **Text + Image Example**

```text
Analyze this architectural diagram and:
1. Identify all components
2. Describe data flow
3. Suggest improvements
4. Highlight potential failure points

[Image attachment]
```

### **Text + Code Example**

````text
Review this code for security vulnerabilities:

```python
[Code block here]
````

Focus on:

- Input validation
- Authentication/authorization
- Data exposure risks
- Injection vulnerabilities

```

## üß™ Experimental Techniques

### **Constitutional AI**
Train the model to follow a set of principles or "constitution" for ethical and accurate responses.

### **Tree of Thoughts**
Explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously and select the best one.

### **Program-Aided Language Models**
Combine natural language reasoning with code execution for mathematical and logical tasks.

### **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
Enhance prompts with relevant information retrieved from external knowledge bases.
