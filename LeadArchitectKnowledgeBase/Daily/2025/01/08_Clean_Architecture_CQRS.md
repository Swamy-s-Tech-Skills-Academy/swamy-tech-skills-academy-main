# **Clean Architecture with CQRS, MediatR, and Filtering: A Comprehensive Guide**

This guide provides detailed best practices for implementing queries and filtering in a C# API using **Clean Architecture**, **CQRS** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), and **MediatR**. It emphasizes maintainability, scalability, and testability.

Excellent! `dotnet-cleanarch-cqrs-sample` is a great choice. It's concise, descriptive, uses relevant keywords, and follows common GitHub naming conventions.

Now that you've chosen the name, here's a detailed checklist for setting up your repository and creating a compelling README:

**1. Create the GitHub Repository:**

- Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
- Name it `dotnet-cleanarch-cqrs-sample`.
- Choose whether you want it to be public or private (public is recommended for sharing samples).
- Initialize the repository with a README file (this will give you a basic `README.md` to start with).
- Choose a license (MIT is a common and permissive choice).

**2. Project Setup (in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE):**

- Create a new .NET Web API project (or a .NET solution with multiple projects if you want to separate layers into different projects).
- Install the necessary NuGet packages:
  - `MediatR`
  - `MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection`
  - `AutoMapper`
  - `AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection`
  - `FluentValidation.AspNetCore`
  - `Serilog.AspNetCore`
  - `Serilog.Settings.Configuration`
  - `Serilog.Sinks.Console`
  - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` (and the provider you'll be using, like `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` or `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory`)
- Structure your project according to Clean Architecture principles (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation).

**3. Implement the Sample Code:**

- Implement the entities, DTOs, queries, handlers, repository interfaces, repository implementations, validators, and the pipeline behavior as discussed in the previous responses.
- Make sure to include examples of different filtering scenarios.
- Implement the error handling middleware and logging with Serilog.

**4. Create a Comprehensive `README.md`:**

This is the most crucial part for making your repository useful. Here's a suggested structure and content:
