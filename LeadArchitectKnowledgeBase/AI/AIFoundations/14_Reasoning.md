# Reasoning in AI

Reasoning refers to the capability of AI systems to draw inferences, explanations, and decisions based on available information and learned knowledge.

## 1. Types of Reasoning
- **Deductive Reasoning:** Derive specific conclusions from general rules (e.g., logic-based systems).
- **Inductive Reasoning:** Infer general patterns from observed examples (e.g., learning from data).
- **Abductive Reasoning:** Formulate the most likely explanations given incomplete observations.

## 2. Incorporating Reasoning in Models
- **Neuro-Symbolic Approaches:** Combine neural networks with symbolic logic for interpretable inference.
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** In large language models, prompting intermediate reasoning steps to improve multi-step inference.
- **Programmatic Reasoning:** Models generate and execute code to perform reasoning tasks.

## 3. Applications
- **Question Answering:** Explaining answers via reasoning chains.
- **Decision Support:** Medical diagnosis, financial analysis.
- **Planning and Robotics:** Sequencing actions based on goal inference.

## 4. Challenges
- **Explainability:** Ensuring reasoning steps are transparent.
- **Robustness:** Avoiding faulty inferences from spurious correlations.
- **Integration:** Balancing end-to-end learning with explicit reasoning modules.
