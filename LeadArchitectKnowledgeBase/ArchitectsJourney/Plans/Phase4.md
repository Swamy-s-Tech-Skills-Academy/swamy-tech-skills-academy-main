### 🎯 **Goal**

- **Advanced Architectures:**  
  ➤ Master microservices patterns (CQRS, Saga, API Gateway, Backends for Frontends, Strangler Fig) and API design best practices (REST, GraphQL).
- **Reliability:**  
  ➤ Implement advanced HA/DR strategies (geo-redundancy, multi-region deployments, Azure Site Recovery, availability zones) and business continuity planning.
- **Operational Excellence & Compliance:**  
  ➤ Build automated CI/CD pipelines, adopt advanced IaC practices, and ensure compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOC 2) using Azure Policy, Blueprints, and cost optimization techniques.

### 🛠️ **Activities**

1. **Design Complex Microservices Architecture:**

   - **Task:** Design a microservices architecture incorporating advanced patterns like CQRS and Saga.
   - **Focus:** Document design decisions, trade-offs, and implementation details using diagramming tools such as C4 Model or ArchiMate.

2. **Develop a Comprehensive Disaster Recovery Plan:**

   - **Task:** Create a DR plan for a mission-critical application, defining RTO/RPO targets.
   - **Focus:** Implement failover/failback procedures using Azure Site Recovery and conduct DR drills.

3. **Implement a Robust CI/CD Pipeline:**

   - **Task:** Build an automated CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.
   - **Focus:** Employ advanced branching strategies (e.g., Gitflow), integrate automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end), and include IaC testing.

4. **Practice Incident Response & Postmortem Analysis:**

   - **Task:** Simulate various incident scenarios (application errors, outages, security breaches).
   - **Focus:** Follow a defined incident management process, conduct blameless postmortems, and document lessons learned.

5. **Design a Compliant System Architecture:**

   - **Task:** Design an architecture that meets compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
   - **Focus:** Document implemented compliance controls using Azure services, enforced via Azure Policy and Blueprints.

6. **Implement Cost Optimization Strategies:**
   - **Task:** Apply cost optimization techniques such as Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, and VM right-sizing.
   - **Focus:** Analyze Azure Cost Management reports to identify and document cost-saving opportunities.
