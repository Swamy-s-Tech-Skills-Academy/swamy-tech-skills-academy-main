**Which Plan Should You Choose?**

- **30-Day Plan:** Choose this if you have a strong foundation in software architecture and are comfortable with a fast-paced schedule. This is best if you have limited time before your interview.
- **45-Day Plan:** Choose this if you have some existing knowledge and want a more balanced approach that allows for deeper dives and more practice than the 30-day plan.
- **60-Day Plan:** Choose this if you have a longer timeframe before your interview and want the most comprehensive preparation possible. This plan allows for extensive practice, deep dives into specific technologies, and ample time for review and refinement.

**Recommendation:**

If you have the time, the **60-day plan is the most comprehensive** and will likely provide the best preparation. However, if your interview is sooner, the **45-day plan offers a good balance** between depth and time commitment. If you're very short on time, the **30-day plan is a good starting point**, but you'll need to be highly selective about what you focus on.

No matter which plan you choose, remember these key points:

- **Tailor the plan:** Customize the plan to the specific company, role, and your own strengths and weaknesses.
- **Prioritize:** Focus on the most important concepts and skills first.
- **Be consistent:** Consistent daily practice is more effective than sporadic cramming.
- **Practice actively:** Focus on problem-solving, diagramming, and explaining concepts out loud.
