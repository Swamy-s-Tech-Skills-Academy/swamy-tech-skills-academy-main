### 🛠️ Activities

1. **End-to-End Data Pipeline:**  
   - Build a secure pipeline that ingests 1GB/hour from Blob Storage to Synapse Analytics, transforms data using Databricks, and visualizes it in Power BI. Secure the pipeline using Managed Identities, RBAC, data quality checks, and monitoring.

2. **Security & Governance Setup:**  
   - Configure a sample Azure environment to enforce compliance via Azure Policy, monitor security with Defender for Cloud, manage secrets with Key Vault, and implement Azure AD Conditional Access.

3. **Comprehensive Monitoring & Alerting:**  
   - Implement Application Insights and Azure Monitor for performance tracking, set up custom alerts, and build dashboards with Log Analytics to monitor application health.

4. **Disaster Recovery Planning:**  
   - Develop and test a disaster recovery plan using Azure Site Recovery, defining RTO/RPO and executing failover/failback procedures.

5. **Automated Deployment & CI/CD:**  
   - Automate infrastructure and application deployments using ARM Templates or Terraform integrated with CI/CD pipelines (Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions) and incorporate automated testing.
