  Deploy a Resource Group and Storage Account using Terraform. Understand the basic workflow (init, plan, apply, destroy) and core concepts (providers, resources, state).

- **Deploy a Simple Web App:**  
  Deploy a simple web app (e.g., a basic to-do list or blog) on Azure App Service including a database (Azure SQL or Cosmos DB) and configure HTTPS. Conduct a Well-Architected Review of the deployed application.

- **Implement Basic CI/CD Pipeline:**  
  Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps and/or GitHub Actions that automatically builds, tests, and deploys your web app‚Äîincluding database migrations‚Äîto Azure App Service whenever code changes are pushed to the repository.

- **Configure VNets, Subnets, NSGs & Load Balancer using IaC:**  
  Use IaC to deploy a Virtual Network with multiple subnets for different tiers (e.g., web servers, databases, load balancers), configure NSGs with specific inbound rules for the web application, and deploy a Load Balancer to manage incoming traffic.
