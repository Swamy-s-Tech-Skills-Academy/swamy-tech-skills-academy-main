> 2. **Conduct a Well-Architected Review** of the deployed application.

✔ **Implement Basic CI/CD Pipeline:**

> 1. Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps and/or GitHub Actions that automatically builds, tests, and deploys your web app—including database migrations—to Azure App Service whenever code changes are pushed.

✔ **Configure VNets, Subnets, NSGs & Load Balancer using IaC:**

> 1. Use IaC to deploy a Virtual Network with multiple subnets for different tiers (e.g., web servers, databases, load balancers), configure NSGs with specific inbound rules for the web application, and deploy a Load Balancer to manage incoming traffic.
