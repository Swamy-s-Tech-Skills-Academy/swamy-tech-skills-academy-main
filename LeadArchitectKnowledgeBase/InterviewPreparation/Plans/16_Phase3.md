> - **Requirements:** Secure the pipeline with Managed Identities, enforce RBAC, and implement data quality checks and monitoring.
> - **Review:** Conduct a Well-Architected Review focusing on reliability, performance, and cost.

> **2. Security & Governance Lab:**
>
> - **Activity:** Configure a sample Azure environment with robust security and governance:
>   - Implement Azure Policy to enforce compliance (allowed resource types, regions, tags).
>   - Configure Azure Security Center/Defender for Cloud to monitor vulnerabilities and apply recommendations.
>   - Set up Azure Key Vault for managing secrets, certificates, and keys.
>   - Enforce Azure AD Conditional Access policies.
> - **Review:** Conduct a Well-Architected Review of the environment’s security posture.

> **3. Observability & Monitoring Setup:**
>
> - **Activity:** Deploy an application (e.g., on AKS or App Service) and configure comprehensive monitoring:
>   - Set up Application Insights for performance monitoring and distributed tracing.
>   - Configure Azure Monitor alerts for key metrics (CPU, memory, latency, errors).
>   - Create custom Log Analytics queries and dashboards.
> - **Review:** Validate observability effectiveness through a Well-Architected Review.

> **4. Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan:**
>
> - **Activity:** Develop a DR plan for a sample mission-critical application:
>   - Define Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).
>   - Implement failover/failback procedures using Azure Site Recovery.
>   - Conduct a simulated DR drill.
> - **Review:** Document findings and improvements in a Well-Architected Review.

> **5. CI/CD Pipeline Automation:**
>
> - **Activity:** Automate infrastructure and application deployments using ARM/Terraform and integrate with Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.
>   - Include automated build, test (unit/integration), and deployment steps.
>   - Integrate security scanning (e.g., vulnerability assessments) into the pipeline.
> - **Review:** Validate the pipeline with a Well-Architected Review focused on automation and operational excellence.
