### üõ†Ô∏è 4.3. Activities

‚úî **Advanced Architecture Design:**

- **Activity:** Design a complex microservices architecture that incorporates advanced patterns such as CQRS and Saga, along with API Gateway and Backends for Frontends.
- **Task:** Document your design using diagramming tools (e.g., C4 Model or ArchiMate) and explain the rationale behind your design decisions, trade-offs, and how the solution meets compliance and cost optimization requirements.
- **Review:** Conduct a Well-Architected Review focusing on resilience, security, and scalability.

‚úî **Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan:**

- **Activity:** Develop a comprehensive DR plan for a mission-critical application.
- **Task:** Define Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO), then implement failover and failback procedures using Azure Site Recovery.
- **Review:** Simulate a DR drill and document the process, challenges, and lessons learned.

‚úî **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation:**

- **Activity:** Build a robust CI/CD pipeline for deploying applications to Azure using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.
- **Task:** Incorporate advanced branching strategies (e.g., Gitflow), automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end), and infrastructure as code testing. Include security scanning and vulnerability assessments.
- **Review:** Validate the pipeline through a Well-Architected Review focusing on automation, operational excellence, and security.

‚úî **Cost Optimization & Incident Management:**

- **Activity:** Analyze a sample Azure environment using Azure Cost Management and implement cost optimization strategies (e.g., right-sizing, Reserved Instances).
- **Task:** Develop incident management procedures and conduct a mock incident response exercise, followed by a blameless postmortem to capture lessons learned.
- **Review:** Document your cost optimization findings and incident response process.
