# Consolidated and Enhanced 120-Day Azure Architect/Sr. Staff Engineer Interview Preparation Plan

This plan is designed to comprehensively prepare you for Azure Architect and Sr. Staff Engineer roles. It combines the best aspects, focusing on actionable steps, Azure expertise, and leadership development.

## Few Icons

📚 🎯 ✔ 📌 ✅

## Key Principles

> 1. _Prioritization:_ Focus on the most relevant skills and knowledge.  
> 2. _Consistency Over Intensity:_ Regular study is more effective than cramming.  
> 3. _Spaced Repetition:_ Review concepts periodically.  
> 4. _Active Learning:_ Engage in hands-on activities.  
> 5. _Influence Without Authority:_ Develop influencing skills.

## Phase 1: Foundations & Core Concepts (Days 1-30)  
*(5 Days/Week, ~1 Hour Daily) – 6 Weeks*

This phase ensures a robust understanding of Azure fundamentals, architectural principles, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts. It sets the stage for deeper exploration in subsequent phases by establishing a strong foundation in cloud computing, Azure fundamentals, and IaC.

### 🎯 1.1. Goals

✔ Develop a deep understanding of cloud computing, Azure core services, and architectural principles.  
✔ Gain **hands-on** experience with Azure Portal, CLI, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).  
✔ Learn to evaluate cloud solutions based on **cost, security, scalability, and operational excellence.**

### 📌 1.2. Key Topics

#### ✅ Cloud Fundamentals *(Estimated Time: 2 days)*

- **Concepts:** IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, serverless computing, shared responsibility model.  
- **Economics:** Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), Return on Investment (ROI), Pay-as-you-Go vs. Reserved Pricing.

#### ✅ Azure Fundamentals *(Estimated Time: 4 days)*

- **Pricing & Governance:** Azure pricing models, support plans, Azure Policy, and Blueprints.

#### ✅ Architectural Principles *(Estimated Time: 9 days)*

- **Core Design Patterns:** SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SoC (Separation of Concerns).  
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Strategic (Bounded Contexts) and tactical patterns (Aggregates).  
- **Microservices Architecture:** Principles, benefits, challenges, and decomposition strategies.  
- **Azure Well-Architected Framework:** Focus on reliability, security, and cost optimization.

#### ✅ Azure Core Services *(Estimated Time: 9 days – 3 days per service area)*

- **Compute:** Virtual Machines (VMs), Azure App Service, Azure Functions.  
- **Storage:** Azure Blob, Queue, Table, File Storage.  
- **Networking:** Virtual Networks (VNets), subnets, Network Security Groups (NSGs), Load Balancers, DNS.

#### ✅ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Fundamentals *(Estimated Time: 6 days)*

- **Overview:** ARM Templates, Bicep, and Terraform.  
- **Benefits:** Version control, automation, repeatability, and consistency.

### 🛠️ 1.3. Activities

#### Hands-On Labs & Practical Exercises

✔ **Azure Portal & CLI:**  
- Deploy basic resources (VMs, Storage, VNets) and manage configurations.

✔ **Microsoft Learn:**  
- Complete the Azure Fundamentals learning path.

✔ **Architectural Design Exercises:**  
- Apply SOLID and DDD principles to design simple cloud architecture scenarios (e.g., a web app architecture that factors in scalability and availability).

✔ **Pricing Analysis:**  
- Use the Azure Pricing Calculator to compare costs (e.g., VMs vs. App Service vs. Functions).

✔ **IaC – ARM Templates:**  
- Deploy a parameterized ARM template to create a Storage Account with specific configurations (e.g., storage account type, access tier).  
- Review the template structure: parameters, variables, resources, outputs, and modules.

✔ **IaC – Bicep:**  
- Create a Bicep template to deploy a Virtual Network and NSG.  
- Compare Bicep syntax to ARM Templates, emphasizing improved readability and modularity.

✔ **Storage Activity:**  
- Upload and download files to Azure Blob Storage using the Azure CLI. Experiment with different access tiers (Hot, Cool, Archive).

✔ **Terraform Lab (Optional):**  
- Deploy a Resource Group and Storage Account using Terraform.  
- Understand the Terraform workflow (init, plan, apply, destroy) and basic concepts (providers, resources, state).
