Okay, I've reviewed the updated Phase 1 and it looks fantastic! You've incorporated the valuable feedback and made it even stronger. 

Now, let's move on to **Phase 2: Design Patterns & Azure Deep Dive**.

**Goal:**

> To develop a deep understanding of design patterns, distributed systems concepts, and core Azure services. Gain hands-on experience with advanced Azure services, containerization, and security best practices.  Build the ability to design, implement, and troubleshoot complex cloud solutions.
