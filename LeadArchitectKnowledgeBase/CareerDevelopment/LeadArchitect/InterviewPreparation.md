# Interview Preparation

This document provides tips and resources for preparing for Lead Architect interviews.

**Common Technical Interview Questions:**

- **Architectural Styles and Patterns:**

  - **"Compare and contrast Microservices and Monolithic architectures."**
    - **Monolithic:** A single, unified application with all components tightly coupled. Easier to develop and deploy initially, but can become difficult to scale and maintain as the application grows.
    - **Microservices:** A collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network. More complex to develop and deploy, but offers better scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility.
    - **Key Differences:**
      - Deployment: Single vs. independent deployments.
      - Scalability: Scaling the entire application vs. scaling individual services.
      - Technology Diversity: Limited vs. allows for different technologies per service.
      - Fault Isolation: Failure in one part affects the whole application vs. isolates failures to individual services.
  - **"When would you choose a message queue over a REST API?"**
    - **REST API:** Suitable for synchronous communication where a client needs an immediate response from a server. Good for simple requests and when real-time updates are not critical.
    - **Message Queue:** Suitable for asynchronous communication where decoupling between services is required. Useful for handling high volumes of messages, background tasks, and ensuring reliable message delivery.
    - **Use Cases:**
      - REST: Fetching user data, submitting a form.
      - Message Queue: Processing orders, sending emails, handling background tasks.
  - _(Add explanations for CAP Theorem and Design Patterns similarly)_

- **System Design:**

  - **"Design a URL shortening service."**
    - **Functional Requirements:** Shorten URLs, redirect short URLs to original URLs.
    - **Non-Functional Requirements:** Scalability, availability, performance.
    - **High-Level Design:**
      - Hash function to generate short codes.
      - Database to store mappings between short codes and original URLs.
      - Cache to improve performance.
    - _(Expand on data flow, database schema, and handling collisions)_
  - **"Design a rate limiter."**
    - **Goal:** Prevent abuse and protect the system from overload.
    - **Algorithms:**
      - Token Bucket: Maintains a bucket of tokens that are replenished at a fixed rate. Requests consume tokens.
      - Leaky Bucket: Requests enter a queue (bucket) that leaks at a constant rate.
    - _(Explain the trade-offs of each algorithm and how to implement them)_
  - _(Add explanations for Distributed Cache and Notification System similarly)_

- _(Add other technical question categories: Cloud Architecture, Security, Databases, etc., with similar explanations/examples)_

- **(Behavioral Questions and Preparation Tips remain the same)**

Here's the consolidated version of the Interview Preparation sections you provided:
