# Interview Preparation

I can definitely help you with outlining content for your Lead Architect subfolders. Here's a breakdown of what you could include in each:

**1. Interview Preparation (`InterviewPreparation.md`):**

- **Common Technical Interview Questions:**
  - **Architectural Styles and Patterns:**
    - "Compare and contrast Microservices and Monolithic architectures."
    - "When would you choose a message queue over a REST API?"
    - "Explain the CAP theorem and its implications for distributed systems."
    - "Describe different types of design patterns (e.g., creational, structural, behavioral) and give examples."
  - **System Design:**
    - "Design a URL shortening service."
    - "Design a rate limiter."
    - "Design a distributed cache."
    - "Design a notification system."
  - **Cloud Architecture:**
    - "How would you design a highly available and scalable application on AWS/Azure/GCP?"
    - "Explain the different cloud deployment models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)."
    - "What are the security best practices for cloud deployments?"
  - **Security:**
    - "What are the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities?"
    - "How do you implement authentication and authorization in a web application?"
    - "What are some common security patterns?"
  - **Databases:**
    - "Compare and contrast SQL and NoSQL databases."
    - "Explain database normalization and its benefits."
    - "How would you design a database schema for a specific application?"
- **Behavioral Interview Questions:**
  - "Tell me about a time you had to make a difficult technical decision."
  - "Describe a time you had to communicate a complex technical concept to a non-technical audience."
  - "Tell me about a time you had to resolve a conflict within a team."
  - "Describe your leadership style."
  - "Tell me about a time you mentored a junior developer."
- **Preparation Tips:**
  - Practice answering questions out loud.
