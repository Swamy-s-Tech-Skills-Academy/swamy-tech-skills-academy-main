## üìù Best Practices

### Security
- Use Managed Identities instead of key-based authentication
- Apply least privilege principle to all resources
- Implement network security with Private Endpoints and NSGs
- Use Microsoft Defender for Cloud for security monitoring

### Scalability
- Design for horizontal scaling
- Implement appropriate caching strategies
- Use Azure Front Door for global load balancing
- Apply autoscaling for compute resources

### Cost Optimization
- Use resource tags for cost tracking
- Implement auto-shutdown for non-production resources
- Choose the right pricing tier for each service
- Consider reserved instances for predictable workloads

### Resilience
- Design for regional failover
- Implement retry patterns with exponential backoff
- Use Availability Zones for high availability
- Apply circuit breaker patterns for dependent services
