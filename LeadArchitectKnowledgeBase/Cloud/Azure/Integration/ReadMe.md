# Azure Integration Services

This folder contains resources, patterns, and best practices for Azure integration services.

## Core Integration Services

### Azure Service Bus
- Enterprise message broker with queues and topics
- Guaranteed message delivery and ordering
- Transaction support and duplicate detection
- Ideal for reliable message processing, workflows, and transaction processing

### Azure Event Grid
- Event routing service for event-based architectures
- Serverless, publish-subscribe model
- Built-in events from Azure services
- Ideal for reactive programming, event notifications, and distributed systems

### Azure Event Hubs
- Big data streaming platform and event ingestion service
- Scalable to millions of events per second
- Supports Apache Kafka protocol
- Ideal for telemetry processing, IoT data streams, and real-time analytics

### Azure API Management
- API gateway for securing, publishing, and analyzing APIs
- Developer portal and documentation
- Policy-based control and governance
- Ideal for creating consistent API facades and monetizing APIs

### Azure Logic Apps
- Cloud-based integration service with visual designer
- 400+ connectors to SaaS and enterprise applications
- Serverless execution model
- Ideal for automating business processes and system integration

### Azure Functions
- Serverless compute service for integration
- Event-driven execution model
- Extensive binding system for integration
- Ideal for lightweight integrations and microservices

### Azure App Configuration
- Centralized service for managing application settings
- Feature flags for controlled rollout
- Point-in-time snapshots for configuration
- Ideal for configuration management across distributed applications

### Azure Relay
- Service that enables secure exposure of on-premises services to cloud
- Hybrid connections without firewall changes
- WCF relay for legacy applications
- Ideal for hybrid scenarios and on-premises service exposure

## Integration Patterns & Architectures

### Messaging Patterns
- **Queue-Based Load Leveling**: Manage varying workloads by using queues
- **Publisher-Subscriber**: Event distribution to multiple subscribers
- **Request-Reply**: Synchronous messaging with response correlation
- **Claim-Check**: Handle large messages by storing content externally
- **Priority Queue**: Process messages based on importance
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Handle failed message processing

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Produce, detect, consume, and react to events
- Use Event Grid for routing and Event Hubs for streaming
- Implement event sourcing for stateful applications
- Build decoupled systems with high scalability

### API-Led Connectivity
- System APIs for accessing core systems
- Process APIs for orchestrating business processes
- Experience APIs tailored to specific client needs
- Use API Management to create a consistent API layer

### Integration Patterns with Logic Apps
- Enterprise Integration Pack for B2B scenarios
- Workflow orchestration across multiple systems
- Hybrid integration with on-premises systems
- Long-running workflow management

### Hybrid Integration
- Connect on-premises and cloud services
- Use Azure Relay for exposing on-premises APIs
- Implement integration with Service Bus for reliable messaging
- Connect to legacy systems with Logic Apps connectors

## Best Practices

### Message Handling
- Implement idempotent message processing
- Use sessions for ordered message processing
- Implement retry patterns with exponential backoff
- Handle poison messages with dead-letter queues

### API Design and Management
- Apply consistent versioning strategies
- Implement appropriate throttling and quotas
- Use response caching for improved performance
- Apply consistent security policies across APIs

### Event Processing
- Ensure at-least-once delivery for critical events
- Design for eventual consistency in event-driven systems
- Implement event schema versioning
- Consider partitioning strategies for high-throughput scenarios

### Integration Security
- Use managed identities for service-to-service communication
- Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Apply proper authentication for all API endpoints
- Implement fine-grained access control with RBAC

### Monitoring and Troubleshooting
- Enable diagnostics logs for all integration services
- Implement distributed tracing across integration components
- Set up alerts for anomalies in message patterns
- Use correlation IDs to track requests across systems

## Decision Matrix: Choosing the Right Integration Service

- Implement device command and control with Service Bus
- Manage devices with IoT Hub

### Microservices Integration
- Implement asynchronous communication with Service Bus
- Use Event Grid for event notifications
- Apply API Management for front-end API gateway
- Implement circuit breaker and retry patterns

### Legacy System Integration
- Connect to on-premises systems with Hybrid Connections
- Use Logic Apps connectors for legacy protocols
- Implement message transformation for protocol conversion
- Apply caching for performance optimization
