# Amazon Web Services (AWS) Architecture

This folder contains resources, patterns, and best practices for AWS architecture.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

- `Compute/` - EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda
- `Storage/` - S3, RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache
- `Networking/` - VPC, ELB, Route53, CloudFront
- `Security/` - IAM, KMS, Security Groups, WAF
- `Analytics/` - Redshift, EMR, Athena, QuickSight
- `Integration/` - SQS, SNS, EventBridge, API Gateway
- `DevOps/` - CodePipeline, CloudFormation, CodeBuild
- `Patterns/` - Reference architectures and implementation patterns

## üè¢ Reference Architectures

### Web Applications
- Highly Available Web Applications
- Serverless Web Applications
- Microservices Architectures

### Data Solutions
- Data Lakes on AWS
- Real-time Analytics

## üìù Best Practices

### Security
- Follow the principle of least privilege with IAM
- Implement encryption at rest and in transit
- Use VPC security groups and network ACLs
- Enable CloudTrail for audit logging

### Scalability
- Design for horizontal scaling with Auto Scaling Groups
- Implement caching with ElastiCache
- Use CloudFront for content delivery
- Apply Lambda concurrency controls

### Cost Optimization
- Use resource tags for cost allocation
- Implement scheduled scaling for predictable workloads
- Choose the right instance types
- Consider Savings Plans or Reserved Instances

### Resilience
- Multi-AZ and Multi-Region architectures
- Implement Circuit Breaker patterns
- Apply retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Use Step Functions for complex workflows
