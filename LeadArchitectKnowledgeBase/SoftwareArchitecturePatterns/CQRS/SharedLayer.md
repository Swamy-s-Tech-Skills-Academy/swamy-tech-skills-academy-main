# Shared project

The Shared project (containing your DTOs, interfaces, and other common types) should be referenced by the following layers/projects in your typical layered architecture:

1.  **Presentation Layers:**

    - **`Products.API`:** Your API project _must_ reference the Shared project. It uses DTOs for request and response bodies in its controllers.
    - **`Products.Web` (or other UI projects):** Your Blazor Web App (or any other UI project like a mobile app) _must_ also reference the Shared project. It uses DTOs to display data and send data to the API.

2.  **Infrastructure Layer (Sometimes):**
    - **`Products.Infrastructure`:** In some cases, the Infrastructure layer might need to reference the Shared project, _but only for interfaces or other common types, not for DTOs directly_. For instance, if you have interfaces defining data contracts for external services or message queues, those interfaces could reside in the Shared project and be implemented in the Infrastructure layer. However, _do not use DTOs directly in your data access code (repositories)._ Instead, map from entities to DTOs in the API layer.

**Projects that should _not_ reference the Shared project:**

1.  **Domain Layer:** The Domain layer should be completely independent of any other layer, including the Shared layer. It should only contain core business entities, value objects, and domain logic.
2.  **Application Layer:** The Application layer should also _not_ directly reference the Shared project. As explained previously, it works with Domain entities and relies on the presentation layers to perform the mapping to DTOs.

**Dependency Diagram:**

Here's a visual representation of the dependencies:

```
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
|   Products.Web   |---->|   Products.API   |---->| Products.App   |---->| Products.Domain |
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
      ^                       ^
      |                       |
      +-----------------------+
              |
              V
      +-----------------+
      | Products.Shared |
      +-----------------+
```

**Explanation of the Diagram:**

- `Products.Web` and `Products.API` both depend on `Products.Shared`.
- `Products.API` depends on `Products.Application`.
- `Products.Application` depends on `Products.Domain`.
- `Products.Domain` has no dependencies.

**In Summary:**

The Shared project acts as a central location for types that need to be shared between different parts of your application, primarily the presentation layers. It helps to decouple the layers and promote reusability. The Application and Domain layers should remain independent of the Shared project to maintain a clean and well-structured architecture. This is a very important principle to follow for maintainable and scalable applications.

## Another Point

Excellent! I'm glad to hear that moving the DTOs to the Shared project resolved the errors and allowed you to test your API. This confirms that the project dependencies are now correctly configured.

To summarize the key improvements we've made and reinforce the best practices:

- **DTOs in Shared Project:** Moving DTOs to the Shared project (`Products.Shared`) is crucial for decoupling the API and Web UI from the Application layer. This promotes reusability and maintainability.
- **API as a Thin Layer (Optional but Recommended):** We discussed the option of having the Application layer return DTOs directly, making the API layer even thinner. This is a common and often preferred approach for simpler APIs.
- **Correct Project Dependencies:** The correct project dependencies are now:

  - `Products.Web` references `Products.API` and `Products.Shared`.
  - `Products.API` references `Products.Application` and `Products.Shared`.
  - `Products.Application` references `Products.Domain` and _now also_ `Products.Shared` (if using the thin API approach).
  - `Products.Domain` has no dependencies.
  - `Products.Infrastructure` references `Products.Domain`.

- **Configuration Validation:** We implemented robust configuration validation in the `Products.Web` project to ensure the `API_Base_Url` is correctly configured before the `HttpClient` is created.
- **HttpClientFactory:** We switched to using the `HttpClientFactory` in `Products.Web` for better performance and connection management.

With these changes, you have a well-structured and maintainable application with clear separation of concerns. This will make it easier to add new features, test your code, and adapt to future changes.

**Next Steps and Further Considerations:**

- **Implement Remaining API Endpoints:** Continue implementing the remaining API endpoints for other functionalities (e.g., getting products by ID, creating products, etc.).
- **Implement Blazor Components:** Create Blazor components for other views in your web UI (e.g., product details, product list with filtering, etc.).
- **Error Handling in Blazor:** Implement more robust error handling in your Blazor components to handle API errors gracefully and provide user-friendly messages.
- **State Management in Blazor (If Needed):** For more complex UIs, consider using a state management library like Fluxor or Redux to manage application state effectively.
- **Unit and Integration Tests:** Write unit tests for your Application and Domain layers and integration tests for your API to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

By following these best practices and continuing to build upon this solid foundation, you'll have a robust and scalable application.
