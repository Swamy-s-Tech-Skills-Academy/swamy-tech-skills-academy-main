# "ArchitecturalPatterns" and "SoftwareArchitecturePatterns"

The difference between "ArchitecturalPatterns" and "SoftwareArchitecturePatterns" is primarily one of emphasis and scope, although the terms are often used interchangeably in practice. Here's a breakdown:

**Architectural Patterns:**

- **Broader Scope:** "Architectural Patterns" is a more general term encompassing high-level design solutions applicable to the overall structure of a software system.
- **Focus on Structure and Organization:** They focus on the fundamental organization of a system, dividing it into components and defining their relationships.
- **Examples:** Common examples include Layered Architecture, Client-Server, Microservices, Event-Driven Architecture, and Model-View-Controller (MVC).
- **Can Include Design Patterns:** Some patterns often categorized as "design patterns" (like MVC or Presentation-Abstraction-Control (PAC)) are sometimes considered architectural patterns due to their significant impact on system structure.

**Software Architecture Patterns:**

- **More Specific:** "Software Architecture Patterns" is a more specific term that emphasizes the architectural aspects of these patterns. It explicitly connects them to the field of software architecture.
- **Focus on System-Wide Concerns:** They focus on addressing system-wide concerns like scalability, performance, maintainability, security, and fault tolerance.
- **Examples:** The same examples mentioned above (Layered Architecture, Microservices, etc.) are also considered software architecture patterns.
- **Clearer Architectural Context:** This term makes it absolutely clear that these patterns are relevant to the high-level design of the system.

**Key Differences Summarized:**

| Feature         | Architectural Patterns | Software Architecture Patterns |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Scope           | Broader                | More specific                  |
| Emphasis        | Structure/Organization | System-wide concerns           |
| Interchangeable | Often used as such     | More precise terminology       |

**Which Term to Use?**

In most cases, the terms are interchangeable, and using either "Architectural Patterns" or "Software Architecture Patterns" will be understood. However, if you want to be more precise and emphasize the architectural relevance of the patterns, using "Software Architecture Patterns" is slightly preferred.

**In your Knowledge Base:**

Since you've chosen to create a separate folder for architectural patterns, using `SoftwareArchitecturePatterns` is a good choice. It makes the purpose of the folder clearer and distinguishes it from other types of patterns (like design patterns).

Therefore, keeping the folder named `SoftwareArchitecturePatterns` and placing CQRS within it is the most appropriate approach for your knowledge base.
