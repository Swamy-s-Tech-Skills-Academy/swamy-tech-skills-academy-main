# CQRS Implementation

Great! I'm ready to assist you with your dotnet-cleanarch-cqrs-sample project. I understand you're working with a Clean Architecture, CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) approach in .NET.

To best help you, please provide me with specific questions or areas where you need assistance. For example, you might ask about:

- **Project Structure:** "How should I structure my project to adhere to Clean Architecture principles with CQRS?"
- **CQRS Implementation:** "Can you give me an example of a command handler and a query handler in C#?"
- **MediatR:** "How can I effectively use MediatR to implement CQRS in my .NET application?"
- **Data Access:** "What's a good approach for data access in a Clean Architecture with CQRS?"
- **Testing:** "How should I test my command and query handlers?"
- **Specific Code Issues:** "I'm getting this error... [paste code and error message]"

Here are some general points to consider when building a dotnet-cleanarch-cqrs-sample:

- **Clean Architecture Layers:**

  - **Domain:** Contains core business logic and entities. This layer is independent of any frameworks or infrastructure.
  - **Application:** Contains use cases or application logic. This layer orchestrates the domain logic. This is where your command and query handlers reside.
  - **Infrastructure:** Contains concrete implementations of interfaces defined in the Application layer. This includes data access, external services, etc.
  - **Presentation (or API):** The user interface or API that interacts with the Application layer.

- **CQRS Principles:**

  - **Separate Models:** Use separate models for commands (write operations) and queries (read operations).
  - **Commands:** Represent an intent to change the system's state. They are typically handled by a command handler.
  - **Queries:** Retrieve data from the system without modifying its state. They are typically handled by a query handler.

- **MediatR (Recommended):** A popular .NET library that simplifies the implementation of CQRS and other messaging patterns. It acts as a mediator between your commands/queries and their respective handlers.

I'm here to help you navigate these concepts and provide concrete examples. Just let me know what you need!
