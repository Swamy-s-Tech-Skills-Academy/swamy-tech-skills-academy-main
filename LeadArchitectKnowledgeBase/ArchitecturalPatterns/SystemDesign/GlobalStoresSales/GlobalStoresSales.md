You're right to ask for a cleaner, more readable version. Here's the document with improved formatting and some minor clarifications:

**System Design for Global Sales Data Storage and Reporting**

**I. Overall Architecture**

The system employs a hybrid approach: a data lake for long-term storage and a combination of technologies for continuous data flow and reporting.

**II. Data Sources**

- Multiple global stores send sales data.
- Data format: Flexible (e.g., CSV, JSON), requiring a consistent schema.

**III. Data Ingestion (Continuous Flow)**

- **Message Queue:**

  - **Technology:** Apache Kafka (or cloud alternatives: Amazon Kinesis, Azure Event Hubs, Google Cloud Pub/Sub).
  - **Purpose:** Handles high ingestion rates, buffers data, ensures fault tolerance, and enables decoupled processing.

- **Stream Processing Engine:**
  - **Technology:** Apache Flink (or Apache Spark Streaming).
  - **Purpose:** Processes and transforms raw sales data in real-time or near real-time, including:
    - Data validation and cleaning.
    - Data enrichment (e.g., adding store location).
    - Aggregation and summarization (e.g., daily sales totals).
    - Transformation into bill information.

**IV. Data Storage**

- **A. Long-Term Storage (Data Lake):**

  - **Technology:** Object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, MinIO, Ceph).
  - **Purpose:** Cost-effective storage of raw sales data for archiving, compliance, and future analysis.
  - **Data Format:** Parquet or Avro (columnar formats for efficient querying).

- **B. Reporting and Analytics (Data Warehouse/Analytical Database):**
  - **Technology:** PostgreSQL (or cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or specialized columnar databases like ClickHouse, Druid).
  - **Purpose:** Stores processed bill information for reporting, analysis, and business intelligence.
  - **Schema Design (Example):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    -- Other customer details
);

CREATE TABLE bills (
    bill_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    bill_date DATE,
    total_amount DECIMAL,
    -- Other bill details
);

CREATE TABLE bill_items (
    bill_item_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    bill_id INTEGER REFERENCES bills(bill_id),
    product_id INTEGER, -- Consider a separate products table
    quantity INTEGER,
    price DECIMAL
);
```

**V. Data Flow**

1.  Stores send sales data to Kafka.
2.  Flink consumes data from Kafka, processes it, and transforms it into bill information.
3.  Processed bill information is loaded into PostgreSQL.
4.  Raw sales data is also stored in the data lake (object storage).

**VI. Storage Estimation**

1.  **Define Data Schema:** Determine all fields and their data types.
2.  **Estimate Record Size:** Calculate the average size of each sales record in bytes.
3.  **Estimate Transactions per Store:** Determine the number of transactions per day for each store size (small, medium, large).
4.  **Calculate Daily Data Volume:** Multiply record size by transactions per store and by the number of stores of each size.
5.  **Calculate Annual Data Volume:** Multiply daily volume by 365.
6.  **Factor in Growth:** Add a buffer for future data growth (e.g., 20-50% per year).
7.  **Consider Compression:** Use compression techniques (e.g., gzip, Snappy).

**VII. Technology Choices Rationale**

- **Kafka:** Handles high-volume, real-time data ingestion.
- **Flink:** Powerful stream processing for real-time transformations and aggregations.
- **Object Storage:** Cost-effective and scalable for long-term archiving.
- **PostgreSQL:** Provides ACID properties, strong data integrity, and efficient querying for reporting on processed bill data. Suitable for moderate data volumes and complex relationships. For extremely high volumes or complex analytical queries, consider alternatives like Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, ClickHouse, or Druid.

**VIII. Key Considerations**

- **Data Partitioning:** Partition data in both the data lake and PostgreSQL for improved query performance.
- **Data Retention Policies:** Define data retention periods for each storage layer.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring for system performance and issue alerts.

This version uses consistent formatting with bullet points, clearer headings, and code blocks for the SQL schema. It should be much easier to read and understand.

---

#### **III. Data Ingestion (Continuous Flow)**

1. **Message Queue:**

   - **Technology**: Apache Kafka (or cloud alternatives like Amazon Kinesis, Azure Event Hubs).
   - **Purpose**: Handles high-throughput ingestion, ensures fault tolerance, and decouples producers and consumers.

2. **Stream Processing Engine:**
   - **Technology**: Apache Flink (or Apache Spark Streaming).
   - **Purpose**: Processes raw sales data in real-time:
     - Validates and cleans data.
     - Enriches data (e.g., adding store metadata).
     - Transforms sales data into structured bill information.
   - **Example**: Calculating daily sales totals or deriving key metrics on the fly.

##### **B. Reporting and Analytics (Relational Database)**

- **Technology**: PostgreSQL.
- **Purpose**: Stores transformed and aggregated bill data for analytics and reporting.
- **Schema Design:**

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE customers (
      customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(255)
      -- Other customer details
  );

  CREATE TABLE bills (
      bill_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
      bill_date DATE,
      total_amount DECIMAL
      -- Other bill details
  );

  CREATE TABLE bill_items (

      bill_id INTEGER REFERENCES bills(bill_id),
      product_id INTEGER, -- Link to products table if applicable
      quantity INTEGER,
      price DECIMAL
  );
  ```

- **Partitioning**: Use **table partitioning** for large datasets to enhance query performance.

  - Partition by `bill_date`:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE bills_2024 (
        LIKE bills INCLUDING ALL
    ) INHERITS (bills);
    ```

- **Materialized Views**: Precompute frequently accessed aggregates:
  ```sql
  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales AS
  SELECT store_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', bill_date) AS month, SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales
  FROM bills
  GROUP BY store_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', bill_date);
  ```

#### **V. Data Flow**

1. Stores send sales data to the **Kafka** message queue.
2. **Flink** consumes data from Kafka, processes it, and loads:
   - Processed bill data into PostgreSQL for reporting.
   - Raw sales data into the **data lake** for long-term storage.

---

#### **VI. Storage Estimation**

1. **Define Data Schema**: Outline fields and their types.
2. **Estimate Record Size**: Calculate average size of each sales record in bytes.
3. **Estimate Transactions per Store**: Determine daily transaction volume by store size:
   - Small: 500 transactions/day.
   - Medium: 5,000 transactions/day.
   - Large: 20,000 transactions/day.
4. **Daily Data Volume**:
   - Multiply record size by transactions per store and store count.
5. **Annual Storage Requirement**:
   - Multiply daily volume by 365 days, then factor in compression (e.g., 50%).
6. **Future Growth**: Include a 20-50% annual growth buffer.

**Example**: Assuming a record size of 1 KB, 1,000 stores (700 small, 200 medium, 100 large):

- Small: \( 700 \times 500 \times 1 \text{ KB} = 350 MB/day \)
- Medium: \( 200 \times 5000 \times 1 \text{ KB} = 1 GB/day \)
- Large: \( 100 \times 20000 \times 1 \text{ KB} = 2 GB/day \)
- **Total**: ~3.35 GB/day → ~1.2 TB/year (before compression).
