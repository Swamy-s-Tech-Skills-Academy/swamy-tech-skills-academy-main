# Clean Architecture

This folder contains comprehensive resources on Clean Architecture principles, CQRS, MediatR, and related implementation patterns.

## Core Concepts

- **Clean Architecture** - Separation of concerns and dependency rules
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** - Separate models for reads and writes
- **MediatR** - Implementation of mediator pattern for decoupling
- **Domain-Driven Design** - Aligning code with business domain
