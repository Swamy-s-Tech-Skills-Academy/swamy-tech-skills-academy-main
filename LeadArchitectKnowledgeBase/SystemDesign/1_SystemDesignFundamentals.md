# System Design Fundamentals

## Overview

System design is the art and science of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves making architectural decisions that balance functionality, performance, scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will understand:
- Core concepts and terminology in system design
- The system design process and methodology
- Key architectural principles and trade-offs
- How to approach system design problems systematically

## 1. What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining how different components of a system work together to meet specific requirements. It encompasses:

- **Architecture**: The high-level structure and organization of system components
- **Components**: Individual modules or services that perform specific functions
- **Interfaces**: How components communicate and interact with each other
- **Data Flow**: How information moves through the system
- **Infrastructure**: The underlying hardware and software platform

### Key Characteristics of Good System Design

1. **Scalability**: Ability to handle increased load
2. **Reliability**: System continues to work correctly even when failures occur
3. **Availability**: System remains operational and accessible
4. **Performance**: System responds quickly and efficiently
5. **Maintainability**: System can be easily modified and updated
6. **Security**: System protects data and prevents unauthorized access

## 2. System Design Process

### 2.1 Requirements Gathering

**Functional Requirements**: What the system should do
- User registration and authentication
- Data processing and storage
- Business logic implementation
- User interface functionality

**Non-Functional Requirements**: How the system should perform
- **Performance**: Response time, throughput
- **Scalability**: Number of users, data volume
- **Availability**: Uptime requirements (99.9%, 99.99%)
- **Consistency**: Data consistency requirements
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection

### 2.2 Capacity Estimation

Estimate the scale and capacity requirements:

```
Example: Social Media Platform
- Daily Active Users (DAU): 100 million
- Posts per day: 200 million
- Reads per day: 10 billion
- Storage per post: 1KB metadata + 500KB media (avg)
- Total storage per day: ~100TB
```

### 2.3 High-Level Design

Create a basic architecture showing:
- Major components (web servers, databases, caches)
- Data flow between components
- External interfaces and APIs

### 2.4 Detailed Design

Dive deeper into:
- Database schema design
- API specifications
- Algorithm choices
- Security measures
- Monitoring and logging

## 3. Core System Design Concepts

### 3.1 Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling

**Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)**
- Add more power (CPU, RAM) to existing machines
- Simpler to implement
- Limited by hardware constraints
- Single point of failure

**Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)**
- Add more machines to the pool of resources
- More complex to implement
- Virtually unlimited scaling potential
- Better fault tolerance

### 3.2 Load Distribution

**Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming requests across multiple servers
- **Round Robin**: Requests distributed sequentially
- **Least Connections**: Route to server with fewest active connections
- **Weighted Round Robin**: Assign weights based on server capacity
- **IP Hash**: Route based on client IP hash

### 3.3 Data Storage Patterns

**SQL Databases (RDBMS)**
- ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- Strong consistency
- Complex queries with JOINs
- Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle

**NoSQL Databases**
- **Document**: MongoDB, CouchDB
- **Key-Value**: Redis, DynamoDB
- **Column Family**: Cassandra, HBase
- **Graph**: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune

### 3.4 Caching Strategies

**Cache Patterns**
- **Cache-Aside**: Application manages cache
- **Write-Through**: Write to cache and database simultaneously
- **Write-Behind**: Write to cache first, database later
- **Refresh-Ahead**: Proactively refresh cache before expiration

**Cache Levels**
- **Browser Cache**: Client-side caching
- **CDN**: Geographic distribution of static content
- **Reverse Proxy**: Server-side caching layer
- **Application Cache**: In-memory caching (Redis, Memcached)
- **Database Cache**: Database-level caching

---

## 4. CAP Theorem

The CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, you can only guarantee two of the following three properties:

### Consistency (C)
All nodes see the same data at the same time. Every read receives the most recent write or an error.

### Availability (A)
The system remains operational and responsive. Every request receives a response (success or failure).

### Partition Tolerance (P)
The system continues to operate despite network partitions or communication failures between nodes.

### Trade-offs in Practice

- **CA Systems**: Traditional RDBMS (when no partitions occur)
- **CP Systems**: MongoDB, HBase, Redis Cluster
- **AP Systems**: Cassandra, DynamoDB, CouchDB

## 5. Common Architectural Patterns

### 5.1 Layered Architecture
- **Presentation Layer**: User interface
- **Business Layer**: Business logic and rules
- **Data Access Layer**: Database operations
- **Database Layer**: Data storage

### 5.2 Microservices Architecture
- Decompose application into small, independent services
- Each service owns its data and business logic
- Services communicate via APIs (REST, gRPC)
- Independent deployment and scaling

### 5.3 Event-Driven Architecture
- Components communicate through events
- Loose coupling between producers and consumers
- Asynchronous processing
- Examples: Message queues, event streaming

### 5.4 Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- Services are discrete units of functionality
- Services communicate through well-defined interfaces
- Platform and language independent

## 6. System Design Trade-offs

### 6.1 Consistency vs Performance
- **Strong Consistency**: All nodes return the same data, but may be slower
- **Eventual Consistency**: Better performance, but temporary inconsistencies

### 6.2 Availability vs Consistency
- **High Availability**: System always responds, but data might be stale
- **Strong Consistency**: Latest data guaranteed, but system might be unavailable

### 6.3 Space vs Time Complexity
- **Caching**: Use more memory to reduce computation time
- **Indexing**: Use more storage to speed up queries
- **Compression**: Use more CPU to reduce storage/bandwidth

### 6.4 Synchronous vs Asynchronous Processing
- **Synchronous**: Immediate response, simpler logic, but blocking
- **Asynchronous**: Non-blocking, better throughput, but more complex

## 7. Best Practices

### 7.1 Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have one reason to change
2. **Loose Coupling**: Minimize dependencies between components
3. **High Cohesion**: Related functionality should be grouped together
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Separate different aspects of the application
5. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication
6. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Prefer simple solutions

### 7.2 Scalability Principles

1. **Stateless Design**: Avoid storing session state in application servers
2. **Horizontal Partitioning**: Distribute data across multiple databases
3. **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data
4. **Asynchronous Processing**: Use message queues for non-critical operations
5. **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing and query optimization

2. **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures
3. **Bulkheads**: Isolate critical resources
