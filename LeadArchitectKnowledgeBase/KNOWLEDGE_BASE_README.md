## � What Goes Here

### **Evidence of Learning:**

- Your actual code implementations
- Working examples you've created
- Practical applications you've built
- Problem-solving approaches you've mastered

### **Documented Understanding:**

- Key insights and "aha!" moments
- How concepts apply to real-world scenarios
- Your personal explanations of complex topics
- Decision-making frameworks you've developed

### **NOT What Goes Here:**

- ❌ Plans and intentions
- ❌ Reference materials and templates
