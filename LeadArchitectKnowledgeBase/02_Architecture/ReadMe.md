### **Advanced Track**

1. **Distributed Systems**: [Microservices](./ArchitecturalPatterns/Microservices/) patterns
2. **Complex Modeling**: Advanced [UML](./UML/) techniques
3. **Pattern Composition**: Combining multiple patterns effectively
4. **Architecture Evaluation**: Trade-off analysis and decision frameworks

## üîó Architecture Decision Framework

### **When to Use Each Pattern**

| Pattern                | Best For                                          | Avoid When                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Clean Architecture** | Complex business logic, long-term maintainability | Simple CRUD applications                 |
| **Microservices**      | Large teams, independent deployments              | Small applications, tight coupling needs |
| **Monolithic**         | Small teams, simple deployment, rapid prototyping | Multiple team coordination needed        |
| **DDD**                | Complex business domains, large projects          | Simple data-driven applications          |

## üîß Practical Application

### **Real-World Scenarios**

- **E-commerce Platform**: Microservices + DDD + Clean Architecture
- **Enterprise Application**: Monolithic + Clean Architecture + SOLID
- **Data Analytics System**: Layered Architecture + Design Patterns
- **API Gateway**: Clean Architecture + System Design patterns

## üîó Integration with Other Categories

Connect these concepts with:

- **[03_Development](../03_Development/)**: Implementation practices and methodologies
- **[04_AI](../04_AI/)**: AI system architecture patterns
- **[06_Cloud](../06_Cloud/)**: Cloud-native architectural patterns
- **[07_DevOps](../07_DevOps/)**: Architecture supporting DevOps practices

## üìà Success Metrics

Track your architectural knowledge:

- [ ] Can explain and apply SOLID principles
- [ ] Understands when to use different design patterns
- [ ] Can design clean, layered architectures
- [ ] Creates effective UML diagrams
- [ ] Makes informed monolith vs microservices decisions
- [ ] Applies domain-driven design concepts
- [ ] Designs scalable system architectures

## üí° Key Architecture Principles

### **Universal Guidelines**

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Single responsibility at every level
2. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
3. **Loose Coupling**: Minimize dependencies between components
4. **High Cohesion**: Group related functionality together
5. **Testability**: Design for easy testing and verification

### **Modern Considerations**

- **Cloud-Native**: Design for distributed, resilient systems
- **Security by Design**: Build security into architecture from start
- **Observability**: Plan for monitoring, logging, and debugging
- **Performance**: Consider scalability and efficiency from beginning
