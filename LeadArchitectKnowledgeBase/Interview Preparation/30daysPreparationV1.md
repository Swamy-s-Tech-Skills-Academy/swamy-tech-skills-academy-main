## **Week 1: Foundational Concepts and System Design**

### **Key Topics**

1. **Software Architecture Principles**
   - Refresh concepts like **SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Separation of Concerns, Cohesion, and Coupling**.
   - Explore **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** concepts: aggregates, value objects, domain events.
2. **Architectural Styles**
   - Study **Layered, Microservices, Event-Driven, CQRS, API Gateways, and Service Mesh**.
   - Focus on trade-offs, pros/cons, and best use cases.
3. **System Design Fundamentals**
   - Focus on scalability, performance, availability, database design, and security.

### **Milestones**

- Complete two system design problems.
- Summarize trade-offs between **monolithic** and **microservices** architectures.

### **Daily Plan**

- **Day 1-2:** Principles and DDD (2 hours theory, 1 hour summarizing).
- **Day 3-4:** Architectural styles (2 hours studying, 1 hour comparisons).
- **Day 5-7:** Practice system design (2 hours problem-solving, 1 hour diagramming).

### **Activities**

- Design systems like:
  - **URL shortener** and **e-commerce platform**.
- Compare database choices (SQL vs. NoSQL) for scalability.

### **Assessment Checklist**

- Can I explain **SOLID principles** and **DDD concepts**?
- Can I differentiate between architectural styles?
- Did I design and diagram two systems this week?

## **Week 2: Design Patterns and Practical Application**

### **Key Topics**

1. **GoF Design Patterns**
   - **Creational, Structural, Behavioral Patterns** (e.g., Factory, Singleton, Strategy).
2. **Distributed System Patterns**
   - Circuit Breaker, Retry with Backoff, Saga.
3. **Real-World Scenarios**
   - Design systems under constraints (e.g., latency, cost).

### **Milestones**

- Implement three design patterns in code.
- Write analyses of Netflix, Uber, or Amazon system architectures.

### **Daily Plan**

- **Day 8-9:** Implement GoF patterns (2 hours coding, 1 hour reviewing).
- **Day 10:** Apply Retry with Backoff in a real-world scenario (3 hours coding).
- **Day 11-12:** Study case studies (2 hours research, 1 hour summarizing).
- **Day 13-14:** Mock system design interview with feedback (3 hours each).

### **Mini-Project**

- Build a mini microservices system:
  - Create **2-3 APIs**, integrate RabbitMQ for messaging, and add **caching** with Redis.

### **Assessment Checklist**

- Did I implement three design patterns?
- Can I explain the trade-offs in case studies?
- Did I complete the mini-project successfully?

## **Week 3: Technology Deep Dive and Communication**

### **Key Topics**

1. **Cloud Platforms**
   - AWS (EC2, RDS, Lambda), Azure (App Services, Cosmos DB), GCP (BigQuery, Pub/Sub).
2. **Databases**
   - SQL (ACID, indexing) and NoSQL (CAP theorem, partitioning).
3. **Messaging Systems**
   - Kafka, RabbitMQ (use cases, pros/cons).
4. **API Design**
   - REST vs. gRPC, API versioning.
5. **Communication Skills**
   - Explaining technical designs to non-technical stakeholders.

### **Milestones**

- Create a cheat sheet summarizing key cloud services, databases, and messaging systems.
- Practice explaining one system design to a non-technical audience.

### **Daily Plan**

- **Day 15-16:** Cloud platforms deep dive (2 hours research, 1 hour notes).
- **Day 17-18:** Database and messaging systems (3 hours daily: 2 theory, 1 examples).
- **Day 19-20:** API design and security (3 hours).
- **Day 21:** Communication practice (1 hour design explanation, 1 hour behavioral questions).

### **Assessment Checklist**

- Can I summarize cloud services and database options?
- Can I explain key concepts of messaging systems and API design?
- Did I practice explaining designs to non-technical audiences?

## **Week 4: Mock Interviews and Refinement**

### **Key Topics**

1. **Mock Interviews**
   - Practice **system design** and **behavioral** interviews.
2. **Refinement**
   - Address feedback from mock interviews.
3. **Company-Specific Research**
   - Study the companyâ€™s tech stack and challenges.

### **Milestones**

- Conduct 3-4 mock interviews (mix of technical and behavioral).
- Finalize STAR responses for behavioral questions.

### **Daily Plan**

- **Day 22-23:** Mock system design interviews (2-3 hours).
- **Day 24-25:** Feedback review and system refinement (2 hours each).
- **Day 26:** Mock behavioral interview (1.5 hours).
- **Day 27-28:** Final STAR response review and company-specific preparation (2 hours daily).
- **Day 29:** Final material review (2 hours).
- **Day 30:** Rest and prep for the interview.

### **Assessment Checklist**

- Did I complete at least three mock interviews?
- Did I incorporate feedback to refine designs and answers?
- Am I confident in my STAR responses and system designs?
