## 🎯 **Week 1 Success Mantra**

> **"Start strong, build momentum, establish habits."**

This is about laying a solid foundation for the 12-week journey ahead. Every small win this week builds confidence and momentum for bigger challenges ahead.

**Focus**: Quality over quantity. Better to deeply understand Big-O and successfully implement one good tool than to rush through multiple topics.

**Mindset**: This is Week 1 of becoming a Lead Architect. Every day matters. Every insight counts. Every small step forward is progress.
