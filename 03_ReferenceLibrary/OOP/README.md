## 🎯 Learning Progression Guide

### **Phase 1: Foundations (Week 1)**

1. **Start**: `01_OOP-Fundamentals` - Master core concepts
2. **Practice**: `02_OOP-CSharp` - Hands-on implementation
3. **Visualize**: `03_UML-for-OOP` - Design thinking

### **Phase 2: Advanced Application (Week 2+)**

4. **Advance**: `04_SOLID-Principles` - Professional design
5. **Apply**: Use all sheets together for real projects
6. **Integrate**: Design → Code → Review cycle

### **For Different Use Cases**

**Learning OOP**:

- Fundamentals → UML → C# → SOLID (sequential learning)

**Development Work**:

- C# sheet for syntax, SOLID for design decisions

**Code Review**:

- Fundamentals for concept validation, SOLID for design quality

**System Design**:

- UML for modeling, SOLID for architectural principles

### **For Interview Prep**

- **Conceptual Questions**: Fundamentals cheat sheet
- **Coding Questions**: C# cheat sheet
- **Architecture Discussion**: Both sheets together
