# 01_Cloudâ€‘Native Distributed Apps: Key Characteristics

**Learning Level**: Practitioner
**Prerequisites**: Containers 101, basic DevOps/CI/CD, fundamentals of distributed systems
**Estimated Time**: 30â€“45 minutes

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

- Explain the essential building blocks of cloudâ€‘native distributed applications
- Describe how these components interact endâ€‘toâ€‘end in delivery and runtime
- Recognize common pitfalls and tradeâ€‘offs when adopting cloudâ€‘native patterns

## Conceptual Foundation

This page summarizes the core ingredients of modern cloudâ€‘native systems and how they fit together. We present the ideas in original terms and with fresh diagrams, without vendor logos.

### 1) Microservices (business capabilities)

- Small, independently deployable services that own a clear slice of business functionality and data.
- Communicate over wellâ€‘defined APIs; favor backwardâ€‘compatible changes and contract testing.
- Enable team autonomy and independent scaling, at the cost of increased operational complexity.

### 2) Containers (packaging + isolation)

- Selfâ€‘contained runtime units bundling app, dependencies, and configuration.
- Repeatable build/run parity across dev, test, and prod environments.
- Image immutability and versioning simplify rollback and promotion.

### 3) Orchestrators (scheduling + resilience)

- Platforms like Kubernetes schedule containers onto nodes, handle restarts, placement, and rollout strategies.
- Provide service discovery, autoscaling hooks, and config/secret distribution.
- Helm/other tooling offers release templating and environment overlays.

### 4) Communications (serviceâ€‘toâ€‘service + edge)

- API gateways and meshes add retries, timeouts, mTLS, rate limiting, and traffic shaping.
- Choose protocols intentionally: REST/JSON for simplicity; gRPC for typed, lowâ€‘latency calls; events/streams for decoupling.

### 5) Backing Services (state + integration)

- Datastores (SQL/NoSQL), caches, object storage, queues/streams, and external SaaS.
- Treat them as attached resources with clear interfaces and lifecycle controls.
- Prefer polyglot persistence only when justified by workload characteristics.

### 6) Scalability (elasticity + cost)

- Horizontal scale of stateless services; vertical tuning for stateful tiers where needed.
- Autoscaling driven by SLOâ€‘aligned signals (RPS, latency, queue depth), not just CPU.
- Plan for burst vs. steady workloads; distinguish scaleâ€‘out from scaleâ€‘toâ€‘zero.

### 7) DevOps, CI/CD, and GitOps (flow of change)

- CI produces tested, signed artifacts; CD promotes via progressive delivery (canary/blueâ€‘green).
- GitOps uses versionâ€‘controlled desired state; the platform reconciles runtime to match Git.
- Everything as code: infra, policy, pipelines, dashboards.

### 8) Monitoring & Observability (operational feedback)

- Telemetry: metrics, logs, traces; correlated with exemplars and labels.
- SLOs and error budgets drive release pace and reliability investment.
- Golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, saturationâ€”plus domainâ€‘specific KPIs.

## Practical Example: a simple eâ€‘commerce platform

- Catalog, Cart, Checkout, and Inventory are separate microservices.
- Each builds a container image on commit; images are scanned and signed.
- Kubernetes deploys updated services via a canary; service mesh controls traffic split.
- Checkout writes orders to a database and publishes an event; fulfillment service consumes it.
- Autoscaler reacts to queue depth and P95 latency; cache size scales with traffic.
- Dashboards track SLOs; error budget burn throttles releases automatically.

## Implementation Guide (starter checklist)

- Model services by business capability; align teams to services.
- Containerize with a small base image; pin versions; add SBOM and signatures.
- Use a single orchestrator baseline (namespaces, RBAC, network policy, secrets mgmt).
- Standardize communication patterns (REST + idempotency, gRPC where latencyâ€‘sensitive, events for decoupling).
- Define SLOs and instrumentation up front; wire alerts to userâ€‘impacting symptoms.
- Adopt CI that gates on tests/security; use GitOps for environment promotion.
- Autoscale on meaningful signals; test scale with load and chaos before prod.

## Common Pitfalls

- Too many microservices too early; start modular, split where pain justifies.
- Perâ€‘service tech sprawl; constrain to a curated platform stack.
- CPUâ€‘only autoscaling; ignore latency/backlog leading to brownouts.
- Copyâ€‘pasted dashboards with no SLOs; alerts that page without actionability.
- Stateful services treated like stateless; missing backup/restore/runbooks.
