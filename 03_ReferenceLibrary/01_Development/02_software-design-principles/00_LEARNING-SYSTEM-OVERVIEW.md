### **Same Success Pattern Applied**

✅ **NLP Learning (Aug 11-13)**:

- One-Hot Encoding → Bag-of-Words → TF-IDF
- Daily implementations with external repo
- Consistent capture-only notes

✅ **Software Design (Starting Aug 30)**:

- Encapsulation → Inheritance → Polymorphism → Abstraction  
- Daily implementations with external repo
- Same capture-only note pattern

## 📅 Immediate Next Steps

### **Today (Aug 30, 2025)**

1. **Read**: `99_Quick-Start-Guide.md` for immediate action plan
2. **Create**: Today's learning note using the template
3. **Start**: OOP Foundation Track, Day 1 (Encapsulation)
4. **Implement**: Simple BankAccount class with encapsulation
5. **Capture**: What you learned in your daily note

### **This Week (Aug 30 - Sep 3)**

- **Monday**: Encapsulation fundamentals
- **Tuesday**: Inheritance and IS-A relationships
- **Wednesday**: Polymorphism and dynamic behavior
- **Thursday**: Abstraction and interfaces  
- **Friday**: Practice project combining all concepts

### **Next 8-10 Weeks**

- **Weeks 1-4**: OOP Foundation Track (Generic → C# → Python → Mastery)
- **Weeks 5-7**: SOLID Principles Track (Principles → Implementation → Refactoring)
- **Weeks 8-12**: Design Patterns Track (Creational → Structural → Behavioral → Integration)
