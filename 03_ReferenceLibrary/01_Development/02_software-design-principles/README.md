## 📚 **Learning Path Structure**

### **🔢 Foundation Phase**

#### **01. [OOP Fundamentals](01-oop-fundamentals/)**

#### Core Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

- Four Pillars of OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
- C# Implementation and Best Practices
- Basic UML for Object Modeling
- Language-agnostic concepts and practical application

#### **02. [Advanced OOP](02-advanced-oop/)**

#### Enterprise-Level Object-Oriented Design

- SOLID Principles Deep Dive
- Dependency Injection Patterns
- Async/OOP Integration
- Domain-Driven Design Fundamentals

#### **03. [UML and Modeling](03-uml-and-modeling/)**

#### System Design and Visual Communication

- Advanced Class Diagrams
- Behavioral Modeling (Sequence, Activity, State)
- System Architecture Documentation
- Enterprise UML Standards

---

### **🎯 Principles Phase**

#### **04. [Design Principles](04-design-principles/)**

#### Fundamental Rules for Quality Code

- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- **Single Purpose Principle**
- **Composition over Inheritance**

---

### **🛠️ Patterns Phase**

#### **05. [Design Patterns](05-design-patterns/)**

#### Proven Solutions to Common Problems

- **Creational**: Factory, Builder, Singleton
- **Structural**: Adapter, Decorator, Facade
- **Behavioral**: Observer, Strategy, Command
- **Modern Patterns**: Repository, Unit of Work

#### **06. [Architectural Principles](06-architectural-principles/)**

#### System-Level Design Guidelines

- **Separation of Concerns**
- **Single Source of Truth**
- **Loose Coupling / High Cohesion**
- **Dependency Inversion (System Level)**
- **Scalability and Reliability Principles**

#### **07. [Architecture Patterns](07-architecture-patterns/)**

#### System-Level Design Solutions

- **MVC** (Model-View-Controller)
- **MVP** (Model-View-Presenter)
- **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Clean Architecture**
- **Hexagonal Architecture**
