# 🎯 OOP Foundation Track - Multi-Language Learning Path

**Learning Level**: Beginner → Intermediate  
**Prerequisites**: Basic programming in at least one language  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 weeks (1 hour daily)  
**Next Steps**: SOLID Principles → Design Patterns

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completion, you will:

- Master the four pillars of OOP across languages
- Implement clean object designs in Generic, C#, and Python
- Understand language-specific OOP features and idioms
- Apply OOP principles to solve real-world problems

## 📚 Core Topics Breakdown

### **🔒 Encapsulation**

**Generic Concept**: Bundle data and methods together, control access to internal state

**Implementation Focus**:

- **C#**: Properties, private fields, access modifiers
- **Python**: Name mangling, property decorators, getters/setters

**Daily Practice**: Design a `BankAccount` class with proper encapsulation

### **🏗️ Inheritance**

**Generic Concept**: Create new classes based on existing ones, establish IS-A relationships

**Implementation Focus**:

- **C#**: Virtual/override, base keyword, sealed classes
- **Python**: Multiple inheritance, MRO, super() usage

**Daily Practice**: Build a `Vehicle` hierarchy with cars, trucks, motorcycles

### **🎭 Polymorphism**

**Generic Concept**: Same interface, different behaviors based on concrete type

**Implementation Focus**:

- **C#**: Virtual methods, abstract classes, interfaces
- **Python**: Duck typing, ABC module, protocol classes

**Daily Practice**: Create a `Shape` system with area calculations

### **🎨 Abstraction**

**Generic Concept**: Hide complex implementation details, show only essential features

**Implementation Focus**:

- **C#**: Abstract classes vs interfaces, when to use each
- **Python**: ABC module, abstract methods, interface protocols

**Daily Practice**: Design a payment processing system with multiple providers

## 🛠️ Hands-On Projects

### **Beginner Project: Animal Kingdom Simulator**

Build a simple animal hierarchy demonstrating all four pillars:

```text
Animal (abstract base)
├── Mammal
│   ├── Dog
│   └── Cat
└── Bird
    ├── Eagle
    └── Penguin
```

### **Intermediate Project: E-Commerce Order System**

Design a real-world system with:

- Customer management (encapsulation)
- Product hierarchy (inheritance)
- Payment methods (polymorphism)
- Order processing (abstraction)

### **Advanced Project: Game Entity System**

Create a flexible game entity system:

- Component-based architecture
- Multiple inheritance scenarios
- Dynamic behavior changes
- Performance considerations
