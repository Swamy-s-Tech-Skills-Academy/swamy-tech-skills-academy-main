## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives (What Participants Will Be Able To Do)

By the end of this session, participants can:

1. Explain how GitHub enables collaborative workflows (issues â†’ branches â†’ PRs â†’ merge).
2. Configure basic repository settings (visibility, collaborators, branch protection awareness).
3. Navigate core UI areas: Code, Issues, Pull Requests, Actions, Insights.
4. Use GitHub Desktop to clone, commit, and sync changes without the CLI.
5. Complete a minimal Pull Request workflow (branch, change, PR, review, merge) end-to-end.
6. Identify next-step resources for deeper learning (Actions, Discussions, Project boards).

## ðŸ§¾ Session Agenda (1 Hour)

### 1. GitHub as a Collaborative Platform (10 min)

- Overview of GitHub's role in modern development ecosystems
- Collaboration surfaces: Issues, Discussions, Pull Requests
- Transparency & audit trail (commit history, review metadata)

### 2. GitHub Platform Management (10 min)

- Repository types: public vs private (when to choose which)
- Access control basics (collaborators vs forks)
- Notifications, watching, and subscription hygiene
- Mention branch protection (teaser for future session)

### 3. Exercise â€“ Guided Tour of GitHub (10 min)

- Live walkthrough: repo home â†’ code view â†’ commit diff â†’ branches
- Explore Issues: labels, assignees, commenting
- Pull Requests: conversation tab vs commits vs files changed

### 4. GitHub Desktop (10 min)

- Install & first-run setup (sign-in, cloning a repo)
- Visual diff & staging chunks (partial commit mindset)
- Sync (fetch/pull) vs push â€” clarifying directionality

### 5. Live Demo â€“ Pull Request Workflow (15 min)

Workflow Demonstrated:

1. Create a feature branch (Desktop or CLI)  
2. Make a small change (e.g., edit README)  
3. Commit with a convention (feat/docs chore)  
4. Push branch â†’ open Pull Request  
5. Add description + reference an issue (if any)  
6. Reviewer comment + update commit (amend or follow-up commit)  
7. Merge (squash vs merge commit rationale)  
8. Delete branch and confirm main updated

### 6. Wrap-up & Q&A (5 min)

- Recap: Collaboration surfaces + PR flow + Desktop utility
- Highlight next exploration areas: Actions, Projects, Codespaces
- Provide resource list (GitHub Docs, Microsoft Learn paths)

## ðŸ§ª Quick Success Checks (Facilitator Prompts)

| Check | Prompt | Target Outcome |
| ----- | ------ | -------------- |
| UI Navigation | "Open the latest commit diff" | Participant reaches commit view quickly |
| Branching | "Show me your new branch locally" | Local branch exists & tracked |
| PR Creation | "Paste your PR URL" | PR created with description |
| Review Response | "Apply suggested change & push" | Update appears in PR timeline |
| Merge Choice | "Why choose squash here?" | Can articulate clean history benefit |

## ðŸ§© Optional Stretch (If Ahead of Time)

- Add a CODEOWNERS file and open a PR to show automatic reviewer assignment
- Enable Discussions and create a starter topic
- Create a draft PR to illustrate early feedback workflows
