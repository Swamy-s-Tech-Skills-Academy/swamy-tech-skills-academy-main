# 05 Branching Patterns

**Code**: DEV-GIT-002  
**Learning Level**: Intermediate  
**Status**: Stub  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-20  
**Prerequisites**: 03_Core-Git-Concepts.md  

## Purpose
Compare common branching models and their trade-offs for velocity, risk, and release cadence.

## Models (Planned)
- Trunk-Based Development
- GitHub Flow
- Git Flow (and why it's often overused)
- Release Branching / Maintenance Lines
- Environment Branches (anti-pattern analysis)

## Evaluation Criteria
- Mean time to merge
- Integration friction
- Hotfix latency
- Cognitive load

## TODO
- Add comparison table (criteria Ã— model)
- Add guidance on transition strategy

## Forward Links
- 06_Rewriting-History.md (rebasing & squash in models)
- 07_Automation-and-CI-CD.md (pipelines aligning with model)

## Backward Links
- 03_Core-Git-Concepts.md (refs, merges, fast-forward)
