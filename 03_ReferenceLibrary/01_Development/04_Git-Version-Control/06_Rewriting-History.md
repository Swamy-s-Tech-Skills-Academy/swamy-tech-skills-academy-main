# 06 Rewriting History

**Code**: DEV-GIT-004  
**Learning Level**: Advanced  
**Status**: Stub  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-20  
**Prerequisites**: 04_Undo-Strategies.md  

## Purpose

Safely reshape commit series to improve clarity while preserving collaborative integrity.

## Techniques (Planned)

- Interactive rebase (squash, fixup, reorder)
- Filter-repo for sensitive data removal
- Commit splitting & restructuring
- Force push policies & server protections
- Signed commits / integrity concerns

## Risk Mitigation

- Published vs unpublished history boundary
- Protecting mainline with server rules

## TODO

- Add decision flowchart (edit vs revert vs rebase)
- Add sample interactive rebase script

## Forward Links

- 07_Automation-and-CI-CD.md (enforce policies)

## Backward Links

- 04_Undo-Strategies.md
