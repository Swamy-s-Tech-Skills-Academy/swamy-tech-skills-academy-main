## Purpose
Map safe recovery techniques for common failure scenarios without losing valuable history.

## Scope (Planned)
- Commit amendment vs new commit
- Soft / mixed / hard reset (risk matrix)
- Reflog driven recovery workflow
- Revert for public history
- Cherry-pick for selective transfer
- Stash strategies (single vs named vs patches)

## TODO
- Add decision table (scenario → command → safety rating)
- Add exercises (broken commit, lost branch, force push revert)

## Forward Links
- 05_Branching-Patterns.md (branch hygiene impacts recovery)
- 06_Rewriting-History.md (advanced cleanup)

## Backward Links
- 03_Core-Git-Concepts.md (object model & refs)
