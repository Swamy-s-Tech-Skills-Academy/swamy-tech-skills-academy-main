**Estimated Time**: 25–40 minutes

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand what .NET Aspire aims to solve in cloud‑native .NET development
- Learn its core building blocks and developer workflow
- See where Aspire fits alongside containers and orchestrators

## What is .NET Aspire? (in our words)

An opinionated, batteries‑included stack for building cloud‑ready .NET apps. Aspire focuses on:

- Local orchestration of multi‑service apps during development
- Sensible defaults for telemetry, configuration, and service wiring
- Repeatable deployments to cloud targets with minimal friction

Think of it as a “developer cockpit” that coordinates .NET services and common dependencies (databases, queues) locally while preparing you for production environments.

## Core Pieces

- Templates and project types that encourage service boundaries
- Service discovery and environment wiring for local runs
- Built‑in observability: metrics/logs/traces with standard conventions
- Configuration story that scales from dev → test → prod

## End‑to‑End Flow

## Practical Tips

- Keep services small; isolate responsibilities; expose HTTP/gRPC contracts
- Use environment variables and appsettings layering; avoid hard‑coding endpoints
- Standardize telemetry and correlation IDs early
- Build containers in CI; scan and sign images; pin base images

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating local defaults as production‑ready configs
- Service sprawl without clear ownership or SLIs/SLOs
- Ignoring resource limits locally, leading to surprises in prod

## Next Steps

- Explore: `06-architectural-principles/01_Cloud-Native-Distributed-Apps-Key-Characteristics.md`
- Prepare: containerize services and define a minimal CI pipeline
- Optional: add a service mesh and progressive delivery once in an orchestrator
