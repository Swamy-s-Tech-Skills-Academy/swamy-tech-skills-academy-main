## 🗓️ Daily Update Workflow (lightweight)

- Add or edit content in the correct domain folder using the STSA section structure
- Cross-link from the domain README and at least one adjacent domain
- Prefer ASCII diagrams; add Mermaid as optional fallback if helpful
- Update “Last Updated” in the edited README(s)
- Quick sanity check on numbering consistency (05 LLMs, 06 MCP, 07 Agents)
