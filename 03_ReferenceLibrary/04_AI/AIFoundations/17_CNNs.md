# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized class of deep neural networks designed to process data with a grid-like topology, particularly images. They have revolutionized computer vision by automatically learning spatial hierarchies of features through the application of convolution operations.

## 1. Core Architecture Components

### 1.1. Convolutional Layers

Convolutional layers are the fundamental building blocks of CNNs that apply learnable filters (kernels) to input data:

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Local Connectivity:** Each neuron connects to a small, local region of the input
- **Parameter Sharing:** The same filter weights are used across all spatial locations
- **Translation Invariance:** Features can be detected regardless of their position in the input

#### Convolution Operation:
The convolution operation can be expressed as:
```
(f * g)(t) = Σ f(τ) * g(t - τ)
```

For 2D images:
```
(I * K)(i,j) = ΣΣ I(m,n) * K(i-m, j-n)
```

Where:
- **I** is the input image
- **K** is the kernel/filter
- ***** denotes convolution operation

#### Filter Properties:
- **Size:** Commonly 3×3, 5×5, or 7×7 pixels
- **Depth:** Matches input channels (e.g., 3 for RGB images)
- **Number:** Multiple filters detect different features
- **Stride:** Step size for moving the filter across the input
- **Padding:** Border handling (valid, same, or full padding)

### 1.2. Pooling Layers

Pooling layers reduce spatial dimensions while retaining important information:

#### Types of Pooling:
- **Max Pooling:** Selects maximum value in each pooling window
- **Average Pooling:** Computes average value in each pooling window
- **Global Pooling:** Reduces entire feature map to single value per channel

#### Benefits:
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduces computational load
- **Translation Invariance:** Small shifts in input don't affect output
- **Overfitting Prevention:** Acts as regularization technique

### 1.3. Activation Functions

Non-linear activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network:

#### Common Activations:
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** f(x) = max(0, x)
  - Most popular due to computational efficiency
  - Helps mitigate vanishing gradient problem
- **Leaky ReLU:** f(x) = max(αx, x) where α < 1
- **ELU (Exponential Linear Unit):** Smooth activation with negative values
- **Swish:** f(x) = x * sigmoid(x), self-gated activation

### 1.4. Normalization Layers

Normalization techniques improve training stability and convergence:

#### Batch Normalization:
- Normalizes inputs to each layer across the batch dimension
- Reduces internal covariate shift
- Allows higher learning rates and acts as regularization

#### Layer Normalization:
- Normalizes across the feature dimension
- More stable for variable batch sizes

└─────── identity skip ────────┘
```

## 3. Key CNN Concepts

### 3.1. Feature Hierarchy

CNNs learn hierarchical feature representations:

#### Layer-wise Feature Learning:
1. **Early Layers:** Detect low-level features (edges, corners, textures)
2. **Middle Layers:** Combine low-level features into patterns and motifs
3. **Deep Layers:** Recognize high-level concepts (objects, faces, scenes)

### 3.2. Receptive Field

The receptive field is the region of input that influences a particular feature:

#### Calculation:
- **Receptive Field Size:** Grows with network depth
- **Effective Receptive Field:** Actual influential region (often smaller than theoretical)
- **Design Consideration:** Must be large enough to capture relevant patterns

### 3.3. Translation Equivariance

CNNs exhibit translation equivariance due to convolution operation:
- **Property:** If input shifts, output shifts by same amount
- **Benefit:** Consistent feature detection across spatial locations
- **Limitation:** Pooling introduces some translation invariance but reduces equivariance
