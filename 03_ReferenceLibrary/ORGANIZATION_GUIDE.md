## Comprehensive mapping of AI ecosystem domains with clear boundaries and relationships

## üéØ Organizational Philosophy

Our reference library follows the **interconnected domain model** where each folder represents a distinct field while maintaining clear relationships with related domains. This structure reflects the reality that modern AI solutions typically combine multiple domains.

## üéØ Maintenance & Evolution

### **Folder Management**

- **Domain Ownership**: Each folder has clear scope and purpose
- **Content Migration**: Move content when scope changes
- **Relationship Updates**: Keep cross-references current
- **Scope Expansion**: Add new domains as needed

### **Deprecation & Renumbering Policy**

When learning sequences are renumbered or restructured to improve pedagogy:

1. **Canonical Files First**: Create (or move) the authoritative content at its new numbered filename.
2. **Redirect Stubs**: Replace the old filename with a short Markdown stub that includes: deprecated notice; bold forward link to canonical file; one-sentence rationale (e.g., sequencing normalization, insertion of new foundational module); removal target date (90‚Äì180 day window) and last-reviewed date.
3. **Internal Link Sweep**: Update all internal cross-references to point to the canonical file (avoid chaining through stubs).
4. **Lychee Integrity**: Keep stubs until repository-wide link scans show zero references to the deprecated path for two consecutive review cycles.
5. **Sunset Removal**: Remove the stub file after the retention window; add an entry to a central CHANGELOG (future) or migration note section for historical traceability.
6. **Avoid Silent Deletes**: Never delete or rename numbered learning modules without adding a stub (prevents external link rot and preserves learner bookmarks).

#### Stub Template

```markdown
# {OLD_NUMBER}_{Title} (Renumbered ‚Üí {NEW_NUMBER}_{Title}.md)

**‚û°Ô∏è Go to: [{NEW_NUMBER}_{Title}.md]({NEW_NUMBER}_{Title}.md)**

This module was renumbered as part of sequence restructuring to improve progression clarity.

**Deprecated**: Yes  
**Original Path**: {old relative path}  
**Canonical Path**: {new relative path}  
**Removal Target**: {YYYY-MM-DD} (‚â•90 days from change)  
**Last Reviewed**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
```

#### Rationale

Renumbering is sometimes required when:

- Inserting foundational material earlier in the sequence
- Splitting an overloaded module into multiple focused ones
- Aligning numbering across parallel tracks (e.g., AI Agents vs LLM Fundamentals)

#### Review Cadence

- Perform a quarterly audit of deprecated stubs
- Remove any past their removal target with no inbound references
- Document removals in the central CHANGELOG (planned) or quarterly audit note

> NOTE: Current active stubs (Aug 2025): legacy agent files 01_‚Äì06_ redirecting to canonical 03_‚Äì08_.

### **Future Considerations**

Potential additional domains:

- `ComputerVision/` (if it grows beyond DeepLearning scope)
- `Robotics/` (for physical AI applications)
- `QuantumML/` (for quantum machine learning)
- `MLOps/` (for deployment and operations)
