# 03_Transformer-Deep-Dive

Learning Level: Intermediate to Advanced  
Prerequisites: 01_LLM-Fundamentals, basic linear algebra and probability  
Estimated Time: 90â€“120 minutes

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Explain attention, self-attention, and cross-attention with shapes and flows
- Trace data through encoder/decoder blocks and residual pathways
- Compare positional encodings (absolute/rotary/alibi) and when to use each
- Identify scaling bottlenecks and mitigation strategies (KV caching, sparse attention)

## ðŸ“‹ Content Sections

### Conceptual Foundation

- Attention as content-based addressing; Q/K/V intuition
- Multi-head attention and representation subspaces
- Residual connections, layer norm pre/post variants

### Practical Examples

- Shape walkthroughs for a tiny transformer (B, T, D)
- Worked example: one attention head with small tensors

### Implementation Guide

- Pseudocode for attention and MLP blocks
- KV cache basics for decoding; sliding window for long context

### Common Pitfalls

- Shape mismatches; masking errors; exploding activations
- Misusing positional embeddings when fine-tuning

### Next Steps

- Proceed to 04_Training-and-Fine-Tuning
