# 08_Text-Generation-App-Ideas

Learning Level: Mixed (Beginner → Advanced)
Prerequisites: 05_Prompt-Engineering (for intermediate+), basic API usage
Estimated Time: 30–45 minutes exploration + project selection

## 🎯 Purpose

Curated progression of 10 practical text generation application ideas you can build while advancing from single-turn prompting to multi-step, retrieval-augmented, and persona-driven systems. Use this as a sandbox menu to apply concepts from earlier LLM modules.

## 🧭 How to Use

1. Pick one idea from your current comfort band (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced).
2. Define a tiny success spec (input, output shape, acceptance checks).
3. Implement the minimal viable version in under 60 minutes.
4. Add lightweight evaluations (3–5 test cases) before iterating.
5. Level up by adding one complexity dimension (structure, chaining, retrieval, personas).

## 🟢 Beginner (Direct Prompts, Single Call)

Focus: Simple instruction crafting, temperature & length control.

### 1. AI Blog Post Generator

Generate an SEO-friendly draft from a short title or outline.

- Core Skills: Prompt clarity, style modifiers, temperature tuning.
- Minimal Contract:
  - Input: {title, optional outline bullets}
  - Output: 5–8 paragraph draft + suggested meta description.
  - Guard: Word count within 800–1200.

### 2. Review Response Email Generator

Turn a positive or negative customer review into a professional reply.

- Core Skills: Sentiment conditioning (implicit), tone adjustment.
- Enhancements: Add polarity detection pre-step, style presets (formal, warm, apologetic).

### 3. Educational Q&A (MCQ) Generator

Convert a topic sentence into multiple choice questions with answers.

- Core Skills: Template consistency, distractor variation.
- Structure: JSON array of {question, choices[4], answer, rationale}.
- Extension: Difficulty scaling parameter.

---

## 🟡 Intermediate (Structured Output, Multi-Step Prompts)

Focus: Context merging, output schemas, iterative refinement.

### 4. Resume Tailor

Resume + job description → tailored resume section updates.

- Core Skills: Context injection, key phrase alignment.
- Flow: Extract role keywords → rewrite summary + 3 bullet points.
- Eval: Coverage % of top N keywords.

### 5. Code Comment & Docstring Generator

Add docstrings or inline comments to code blocks.

- Core Skills: Code-aware prompting, preserving formatting.
- Safety: Never alter code token sequence outside comment regions.
- Eval: Regex parse + idempotence check.

### 6. Writing Assistant (Next.js + OpenAI)

Real-time rephrase / tone shift utility.

- Core Skills: UI → API latency handling, prompt parameterization.
- Modes: simplify | formalize | expand | shorten.
- Eval: Length delta & readability score (e.g., Flesch) trend.

---

## 🔴 Advanced (Chaining, Retrieval, Personas, Summarization)

Focus: Multi-pass reasoning, domain grounding, persona frameworks.

### 7. Meeting Minutes Summarizer

Transcript → action items + decisions + risks.

- Core Skills: Chunking, role tagging, structured summarization.
- Tech: Sliding window or map-reduce summarization.
- Output JSON: {decisions:[], actions:[{owner,task,due?}], risks:[] }.

### 8. AI Story Co-Author

Maintain narrative continuity and style over multiple turns.

- Core Skills: Memory/state management, style token extraction.
- Approach: Extract style signature (tone, pacing) each turn → feed into next prompt.
- Eval: Cosine similarity of style descriptors over chapters.

### 9. FAQ Generator from Documents

Manual / knowledge base → canonical FAQs.

- Core Skills: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (embeddings + top-k passages), deduplication.
- Pipeline: Ingest → chunk → embed → retrieve relevant contexts per candidate question.
- Output: {question, answer, source_refs[]}.

### 10. Multi-Stack Summarizer (Vue.js + Flask)

Summaries with persona + word limit controls.

- Core Skills: Persona prompt layering, backend+frontend integration, dynamic constraints.
- Flow: Frontend sets persona & length → backend orchestrates summarization + adaptive truncation.
- Extension: Add evaluation endpoint scoring focus, clarity, brevity (1–5).

## 🧪 Evaluation Patterns

| Complexity | Recommended Checks |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Beginner   | Word count, format presence, basic toxicity screen |
| Intermediate | JSON parse, keyword coverage, idempotence on re-run |
| Advanced   | Retrieval source recall %, style stability, chain latency budget |

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Mitigations

- Hallucinated Facts: Use retrieval or require source citation lists.
- Formatting Drift: Provide explicit JSON skeleton + re-prompt on parse failure.
- Prompt Bloat: Version prompts; prune unused instructions.
- Silent Regression: Keep 5–10 golden test inputs with expected traits.

## 🚀 Next Steps

Pick one intermediate idea; implement with minimal eval harness (CLI script + JSON tests) before jumping to advanced features.
