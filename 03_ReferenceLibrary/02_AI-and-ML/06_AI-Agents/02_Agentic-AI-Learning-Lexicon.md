Consider it similar to how human behavior emerges from the interaction between conscious thought, subconscious reactions, and learned habits.

**Learning Framework**:

- **Reactive Layer**: Immediate responses to environmental stimuli
- **Deliberative Layer**: Strategic planning and complex reasoning
- **Hybrid Integration**: Balancing quick reactions with thoughtful planning
- **Adaptive Mechanisms**: Evolving behavioral patterns through experience

**Practical Learning Implementation**:

```python
# Educational Behavioral Architecture Demonstration
class LearningBehavioralArchitecture:
    def __init__(self):
        self.reactive_responses = {}
        self.deliberative_planner = DeliberativePlanner()
        self.integration_manager = HybridIntegrationManager()
    
    def process_stimulus(self, environmental_input):
        """Educational method showing behavioral processing"""
        
        # Reactive layer - immediate assessment
        immediate_response = self.reactive_assessment(environmental_input)
        
        # Deliberative layer - strategic consideration
        strategic_plan = self.deliberative_planner.analyze_and_plan(
            environmental_input, 
            self.current_goals
        )
        
        # Integration - combine reactive and deliberative
        final_behavior = self.integration_manager.synthesize(
            immediate_response, 
            strategic_plan, 
            self.current_context
        )
        
        return final_behavior
    
    def demonstrate_learning_evolution(self):
        """Shows how behavioral patterns evolve"""
        return {
            'reactive_improvements': self.track_reactive_evolution(),

        self.episodic_storage = EpisodicMemoryStore()
        self.semantic_knowledge = SemanticKnowledgeBase()
        self.consolidation_engine = MemoryConsolidationEngine()
    
    def process_experience(self, new_experience):
        """Demonstrates how agents learn from experience"""
        
        # Add to working memory
        self.working_memory.add(new_experience)
        
        # Extract episodic elements
        episode = self.create_episode(new_experience)
        self.episodic_storage.store(episode)
        
        # Update semantic knowledge if patterns emerge
        if self.detect_learning_pattern(new_experience):
            knowledge_update = self.extract_semantic_learning(new_experience)
            self.semantic_knowledge.integrate(knowledge_update)
    
    def demonstrate_contextual_recall(self, current_situation):
        """Shows how context influences memory retrieval"""
        relevant_episodes = self.episodic_storage.recall_similar(current_situation)
        applicable_knowledge = self.semantic_knowledge.query(current_situation)
        
        return self.synthesize_contextual_understanding(
            relevant_episodes, 
            applicable_knowledge,

        # Analyze environmental constraints and opportunities
        analysis = self.analyze_environmental_context(environmental_data)
        
        # Adapt strategy based on environment
        adapted_strategy = self.adaptation_engine.adapt_to_environment(
            self.current_strategy, analysis
        )
        
        # Execute actions within environmental constraints
        execution_result = self.action_executor.execute(
            adapted_strategy, environment
        )
        
        # Process environmental feedback
        feedback = self.feedback_processor.process_environmental_response(
