# 03_GRU

Learning Level: Intermediate  
Prerequisites: RNN/LSTM basics  
Estimated Time: 20–30 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Understand GRU gating (update/reset) vs. LSTM
- Choose GRU when simpler models suffice

## Conceptual Foundation

GRUs simplify LSTM gating, often training faster with similar accuracy on many tasks.
