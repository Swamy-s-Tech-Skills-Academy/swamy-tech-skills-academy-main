## ❓ Where is Generative AI?

We do not keep a separate “Generative AI” folder. Generative AI is a cross-cutting capability and is organized by the modality/technique:

- Conceptual/strategy overview → `01_AI/04_Generative-AI-Overview.md`
- Text generation and LLM-specific topics → `05_LargeLanguageModels/`
- Image/audio/video and generative architectures (GANs/VAEs/Diffusion) → `03_DeepLearning/` modules
- Language applications and tasks → `04_NaturalLanguageProcessing/`

This avoids duplication and keeps learning paths clear.
